HERO (Home Energy Rating and Optimisation) is a CAD application whose purpose is to calculate the energy efficiency of Dwellings 
(or multiple Dwellings).  
It can be seen as an application similar to Autocad (which is used in Civil Engineering, Architecture, etc) but with 
the specific purpose to do energy efficiency assessment.  
It's a quite complex application that was built in a record time (around 1 to 1 year and a half) and with a much smaller 
budget than competing projects.  
The main view window was built leveraging just the javafx scene graph (retained mode graphics). It has thousands of nodes,
yet it still renders fast and works smoothly.  
This is the type of application that would be practically impossible to do using technologies that leverage the web stack as 
it's an application that is very memory and performance intensive.
