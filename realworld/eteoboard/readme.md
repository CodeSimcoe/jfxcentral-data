**eteoBoard** is a digital Scrum Board which synchronizes the connected clients in real time. 
Therefore, we have written a synchronization engine called SynchronizeFX which synchronizes 
JavaFX properties between multiple clients. We use **eteoBoard** in our own software development 
projects to help our distributed teams optimize their workflow.
