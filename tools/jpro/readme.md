# JPRO

JPRO is a technology which brings Java into the browser — without Java Plugin. To achieve that, JPRO runs JavaFX
on the server and maps its scene graph directly into the browser.

## Browser Characteristics

Don’t worry about all the individual Browser Characteristics. JPro takes care of it for you. You write your source code
against ONE virtual browser, and your solution works for all common browsers, no matter whether they run on desktops or
mobile devices.

## Add JPro to your existing web page

You can mix. It is possible to keep what you have and just add JPro components to your existing web-page. Embedding JPro
components to HTML is trivial.

## Interoperate with existing JS libraries

Through the JPro-WebAPI you can cooperate and communicate bi-directionally between HTML/Javascript and Java.

## Browsers

Use JPro to let your Java App or Java Web Page run in any browser. Whether the browser runs on a desktop or on a mobile
device doesn't matter. You can move it to the cloud, run it on premise, or you can run it on localhost (for
development).
No plugin required.

## Mobile devices

Use the same code for mobile. The Java code you use for browsers can be installed as a native mobile app. You have
the freedom of choice: run your code on the device’s browser, or run it as a native app. Android and iOS are
both supported.

## Desktops

Of course, you can run the same Java code on any of the common operating systems of your desktop. You can run it
wherever a JVM is running (i.e. on a Raspberry PI).
