## Java End-to-End

Harness your existing Java knowledge:

- Build a single application in Java – use the same APIs regardless of device
- Deploy to all platforms privately or via the various app stores
- Massively improve time-to-market – less code and less testing

The guiding principle of Gluon Mobile is to ensure that developers can create high performance, great looking, 
and cloud connected mobile apps from a single Java code base, for iOS and Android.

## Device & Platform Agnostic Native Hardware Services

Make use of hardware features on mobile devices in a platform-agnostic way. Gluon Mobile makes available all 
the storage systems, accelerometers, screen details, GPS devices, and more in a device-independent fashion.
