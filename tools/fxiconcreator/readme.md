# FXIconcreator

FXIconcreator is a small app to create icon sets (multi resolution) for Linux, Windows, OSX from a single PNG image. It removes the need of different virtual machine only to use the native tools to create the icons. It also solves the problem that all the web-based icon converters are generating the icons in the wrong format (not as multi resolution).

All the credit goes to the following opensource projects:

* Javafx: https://openjfx.io/
* iKonli: https://github.com/kordamp/ikonli
* ICNS imcdonagh: https://github.com/gino0631/icns
* ICO #imcdonagh: https://github.com/imcdonagh/image4j

You can build the app via cmd "mvn clean install", inside of the directory where the pom.xml file exists.
