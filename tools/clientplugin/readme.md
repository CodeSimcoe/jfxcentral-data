# GluonFX plugin for Maven

The Gluon Client plugin for Maven projects leverages GraalVM, OpenJDK and JavaFX,
by compiling into native code the Java Client application and all its required dependencies,
so it can directly be executed as a native application on the target platform.

The following platforms are currently supported:

* Linux
* Mac OS X
* Windows
* iOS
* Android
* Embedded

## Requirements
