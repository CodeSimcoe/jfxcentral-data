# JMetro

JMetro is a Java, JavaFX theme or look and feel, inspired by
the [Fluent Design System](https://fluent2.microsoft.design/), a design style introduced by Microsoft. It is a redesign
and improvement of "Metro" design and it is used on Windows.

JMetro is not a theme that tries to mimic the native Windows theme / look and feel, or a theme that is a direct copy of
Fluent Design. It is rather a theme inspired by Fluent Design and adapted to fit the JavaFX SDK. There are also changes
that have been made according to my personal opinions on some of Fluent Designâ€™s particularities.

JMetro is composed by a set controls, stylesheets and skins.
