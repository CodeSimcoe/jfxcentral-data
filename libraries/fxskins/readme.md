# FXSkins

A collection of new Skins for existing JavaFX controls. These Skins will add more functionality to the controls used in
your applications with almost no need to make changes to your applicationâ€™s code.

This is a Java / JavaFX library targeted for Java 11 and above up until the most recent Java version (but should also
work with Java 9 and 10). It is currently being built and tested using the current LTS Java version which is Java 11.
