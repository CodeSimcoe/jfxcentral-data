# TilesFX

TilesFX is a JavaFX library containing Tiles for Dashboards.

At the moment the library contains 50 predefined skins but it's easy to create your own skins. In the TilesFX demo
mentioned below you will find an example on how to create a custom skin. If you would like to find out how to use the
different skins please take a look at the Demo.class in the tilesfx repository.
