Over the years the way of creating GUIs has often changed and JavaFX default appearance is still pretty much the same.
That's where this project comes in. The aim of my project is to bring components which follow as much as possible the
Google's material design guidelines to JavaFX. The second purpose is to provide a successor to the already
available [JFoenix](https://github.com/jfoenixadmin/JFoenix) library, which is a bit old and has a lot of issues.

Over time the project has evolved a lot, to the point that it is no longer a simple substitute.
To date MaterialFX offers not only restyled controls, but also: new and unique controls such as the Stepper, controls 
completely redone from scratch such as ComboBoxes or TableViews (and many others), and many utilities for JavaFX and 
Java (NodeUtils, ColorUtils, StringUtils ...).
