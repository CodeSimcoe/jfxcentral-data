# ControlsFX

ControlsFX is a library of UI controls and useful APIs for JavaFX 8.0 and beyond.

## Usage

If you want to use ControlsFX, then you're probably wondering how to use the API that we've slaved over for hours! In
your case, the best and definitive location for help is
definitely [our JavaDocs](https://controlsfx.github.io/javadoc/). Fear not, these are not a barren wasteland of
undescribed functionality - we've poured our hearts into making these javadocs full to the brim of examples, commentary
and explanation. If anything is unclear to
you, [file a bug in our issue tracker](https://github.com/controlsfx/controlsfx/issues) and we'll do our best to update
the documentation straight away!
