Overview
--------
**FXGraphics2D** is an implementation of Java's `Graphics2D` API that targets the JavaFX `Canvas`.  It makes it possible to reuse existing Java2D code in a JavaFX application.  The code has been developed for the use of **Orson Charts** (http://www.object-refinery.com/orsoncharts/) and **JFreeChart** (http://www.jfree.org/jfreechart).  Numerous demos can be found in the [JFree-FXDemos](https://github.com/jfree/jfree-fxdemos "JFree-FXDemos Project Page at GitHub") project page at GitHub.
