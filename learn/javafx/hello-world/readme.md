How do I make a simple JavaFX Desktop application? Modern software apps require graphic user interfaces (GUIs), and JavaFX is a well-liked framework for creating them. With JavaFX, programmers can easily build GUIs that are both highly interactive and aesthetically pleasing. The code snippet that follows shows how to use the Stage and Scene classes to build a fundamental JavaFX window.

import javafx.application.Application;
import javafx.scene.Scene;
import javafx.scene.layout.BorderPane;
import javafx.stage.Stage;

public class Main extends Application {

    private static final double WIDTH  = 640;
    private static final double HEIGHT = 480;

    @Override
    public void start(Stage stage) {

        BorderPane layoutManager = new BorderPane();
        Scene scene = new Scene(layoutManager, WIDTH, HEIGHT);

        stage.setTitle("Introduction to JavaFX: Creating a Basic GUI Application");
        stage.setScene(scene);
        stage.centerOnScreen();
        stage.show();

    }

}

When the above code is executed, it creates a window or stage as shown in the image down below:
