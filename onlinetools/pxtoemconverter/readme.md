## CSS Pixel-to-EM Converter Tips

### 1. Why "em" Over Pixels?
In the responsive design era, "em" units offer more flexibility than fixed pixel values, allowing for a more consistent appearance across varying screen sizes and resolutions. Transitioning to "em" can enhance the adaptability of your designs.

### 2. How It Works
Simply upload or paste your CSS file, and the tool will:

- Identify all pixel (`px`) values.
- Convert them to their equivalent "em" units.

### 3. What To Expect
The output will be a CSS file where all the pixel values have been replaced with "em" units. This can be directly used in your projects for a more responsive design.

### 4. Keep Base Font Size in Mind
The "em" unit is relative to the font-size of the element (or the nearest parent element). Typically, `1em` is equivalent to the current font-size set. When using the converted values, ensure the base font-size aligns with your design goals.

### 5. Verification Recommended
While this tool aids in the conversion process, always test the resultant CSS on your target platforms to ensure the appearance and responsiveness meet your expectations.
