- Russia has attacked **Ukraine**. Please make a donation if you want to help the people in Ukraine. For example to the [international red cross](https://www.icrc.org/en/donate/ukraine). 
- **Andres Almiray** has [released version 1.0.0-M3 of JReleaser](https://andresalmiray.com/jreleaser-1-0-0-m3-has-been-released/), a general purpose solution for assembling, packaging, distributing and announcing new software releases. With its top-notch support for jlink and jpackage it is ideal for doing exactly that for JavaFX applications. 
- **Dirk Lemmermann** [announced the availability of desktop versions](https://github.com/dlemmermann/jfxcentral/releases/tag/early-access) of JFXCentral for MacOSX, Windows, and Ubuntu.
- **Florian Kirmaier** has [released version 2022-1-0 of JPro](https://www.jpro.one/docs/current/3.1/2022.1.X), which is a solution for running JavaFX applications in browsers. The latest release supports dark mode detection, virtual images, real time updates for writable images, and theme colors. Theme colors cause the browser to pick up the color and use it for its toolbar (Safari, MacOS, Unified Toolbar setting).
- **Florian Kirmaier** [announced the availability](https://www.jpro.one/docs/current/2.12/JPro_Loadbalancer_(Early_Access)) of an early-access release of JPro with support for built-in load balancing, which will allow JavaFX applications to run in the browser and use multiple JVMs on the server side. One possible use-case would be the use of a dedicated JVM for each session / user. This makes migration of existing JavaFX applications trivial as multi-session support is no longer a requirement for the apps.
- **Dirk Lemmermann** has updated the JFXCentral website to use [dark mode detection (YouTube video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqAsIcoN9MY).
- The **Java Client Development Team** at Oracle has [published a job posting looking for a JavaFX engineer](https://inside.java/2022/03/03/ojp-javafx-developer/).
