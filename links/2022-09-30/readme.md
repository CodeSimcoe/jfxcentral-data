* Not from this week (15th of September) but still an interesting read as it lists some of the highlights of JavaFX 19: ["JavaFX 19 rich client Java platform arrives"](https://www.infoworld.com/article/3673888/javafx-19-rich-client-java-platform-arrives.html) on InfoWorld by [**Paul Krill**](https://twitter.com/pjkrill).
* An [interesting discussion in the GitHub
  maven-jpackage-template project](https://github.com/wiverson/maven-jpackage-template/issues/75) - a project by [**Will Iverson**](https://twitter.com/wiverson) to provide a template project for native desktop applications. Seems there is often a request for a Spring Boot UI template. Let's keep an eye on this "BootFX idea" that could be a using the JavaFX embedded web browser.
* Today, [**Gail Anderson**](https://twitter.com/gail_asgteach) is speaking on [IntelliJ IDEA Conference](https://pages.jetbrains.com/intellij-idea-conf-2022) about "JavaFX for Mobile Development". A preview is available on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w4gn_wgaGng), hopefully we can share the recording here next time.
* [**Serendipity**](https://twitter.com/SerendigityInfo) announced on Twitter [SmartFinder 1.5.3](https://twitter.com/SerendigityInfo/status/1573611549335457793), the first app published on Apple Store with Java 19 and JavaFX 19!
* [**WebFX**](https://twitter.com/WebFXProject) - a JavaFX to JavaScript transpiler - announced a [new demo on their website](https://demofx.webfx.dev/), based on the excellent [DemoFX library](https://github.com/chriswhocodes/DemoFX) by [**Chris Newman**](https://twitter.com/chriswhocodes). The demo starts with an introductory animation, asking to click in order to play the actual demo, because in the browser sandbox, playing sound is not permitted before interacting with the user. The resulted demo is just one single java source file. Warning, looking at the demo for too long time can cause brain damage or hypnosis ;-)
* The demos of the visual modeler, written in JavaFX and integrating OpenCV, by [**Alessio Vinerbi**](https://twitter.com/Alessio_Vinerbi) are really amazing. Look at [the video in this tweet](https://twitter.com/Alessio_Vinerbi/status/1573971580409061376) where he modifies two videos on the fly with different visual effects.
* [**Pedro Duque Vieira**](https://twitter.com/P_Duke) tweeted that he is working on a new controls library, soon to be released. [It shows a video of the ListBuilder control with support for drag and dropping of cells](https://twitter.com/P_Duke/status/1572593466286428161).
