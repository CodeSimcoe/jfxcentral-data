* [**Frank Delporte** also announced he started working on a new Java library to load and save #LottieFiles and #dotLottie, plus a #JavaFX player](https://foojay.social/@frankdelporte/109745863000952226). The very early steps are taken with a website, Mastodon account, different Lottie JSON files can already be loaded and saved back to the same JSON, and a very first visual output shows there is some valid data being handled. Maybe you have ideas how to move on with visualizing and animating in JavaFX and want to contribute?
