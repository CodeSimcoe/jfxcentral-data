* At JavaOne on October 20th, some JavaFX related announcements were made.
  * [A tweet](https://twitter.com/JavaFXpert/status/1583174188587589632) by [**James Weaver**](https://twitter.com/JavaFXpert): "Great #JavaFX announcements from @kevinrushforth after being introduced by @mono_quito89 at #JavaOne, while bandmate and @Java legend @BrianVerm mixes drinks. Friend and colleague @johanvos at @GluonHQ highlighted in the process."
  * And a [LinkedIn message](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/btratra_java-javafx-openjdk-activity-6988940880757882880-s4RA?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop) by [**Bernard Traversat**](https://twitter.com/BTraTra): "We announced today we will be producing JavaFX build for JDK 20! Providing a modern UI toolkit for the Java platform will continue to make Java the most compelling platform for educators to teach programming and for UI innovators to explore new rich application UI designs."
  * So the latest JavaFX will not only be available on the [Gluon website](https://gluonhq.com/products/javafx/), but also on [jdk.java.net/javafx20](https://jdk.java.net/javafx20/).
  * Curious what the impact of this announcement will be and what we can share here next week...
* Last week at [**Devoxx**](https://twitter.com/Devoxx) in Antwerp (Belgium) the tweet wall was a crucial part of the information exchange between the visitors, showing the upcoming talks, highest ranked talks, etc. This tweet wall is created by Gluon and the [sources are on GitHub](https://github.com/TweetWallFX/TweetwallFX). 
  * [**Johan Vos**](https://twitter.com/johanvos) shared a [picture in a tweet](https://twitter.com/johanvos/status/1580097937270788096).
  * By the way, TweetwallFX has its own [Twitter account @TweetwallFX](https://twitter.com/TweetwallFX).
  * The official “Devoxx” mobile app is also a JavaFX project by Gluon you can find [on GitHub](https://github.com/devoxx/MyDevoxxGluon). Check the GitHub workflows to learn [more about how it is building and publishing to the Google and Apple stores](https://github.com/devoxx/MyDevoxxGluon/tree/main/.github/workflows).
* The book ["Learn JavaFX Game and App Development with FXGL 17"](https://www.jfx-central.com/books/fxgl17) by [**Almas Baim**](https://twitter.com/AlmasBaim/) got reviewed by [**Frank Delporte**](https://twitter.com/FrankDelporte), read it on [foojay.io](https://foojay.io/today/book-review-learn-javafx-game-and-app-development-with-fxgl-17/).
* [**Dirk Lemmermann**](https://twitter.com/dlemmermann) shared [a screenshot in a tweet](https://twitter.com/dlemmermann/status/1582021109423042562) of the [pull requests in the openjdk/jfx project](https://github.com/openjdk/jfx/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aopen+label%3Arfr): "Wow, 47 pull requests "ready for review" in #OpenJFX. Looks like we have a traffic jam. Some several years old. Some ending with last comment "can you review this?" :-) Hope Oracle really does increase their #javafx team member count."
  * And he also [shared this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwVXO0MdIdk) showing a custom JavaFX control that can be used to display groups of notifications either expanded or as a stack, inspired by the MacOS notification center. However, plenty of customisation options via API or CSS are available to make this control fit into any application.
* [**Clemens Lanthaler**](https://twitter.com/lanthale) released [PhotoSlide 1.3](https://www.jfx-central.com/real_world/photoslide) with many small updates and fixes including new version of librawfx and libheiffx and updates to JDK19/Javafx19 with better Multi-Threading again.
* [**Pedro Duque Vieira**](https://twitter.com/P_Duke) added again a new control to FXComponents library: ReordableListView, a ListView that can be reordered with the mouse by drag and dropping its cells and also supports drag and dropping from an outside source into a ListView cell position as you can see [in the video in this Tweet](https://twitter.com/P_Duke/status/1582732021448978433).
* A [new release 22.3.0](https://github.com/rladstaetter/LogoRRR/releases/tag/22.3.0) of LogoRRR - log file viewer - [has been announced](https://twitter.com/logorrr/status/1581654374719557632).
* [**WebFX**](https://twitter.com/WebFXProject) - a JavaFX to JavaScript transpiler - can now access local files, as you can read on [this GitHub discussion](https://github.com/webfx-project/webfx/discussions/14), with a [demo on files.webfx.dev](https://files.webfx.dev/).
