* On Mastodon [this remarkable question by **Johan Vos**](https://mastodon.social/@johanvos/109444928640623866) appeared: "Maybe it's time to think about moving JavaFX development to a foundation, and have it developed in a vendor-neutral environment, where contributors are highly respected.
  That would require commitments from the industries that use JavaFX of course."
