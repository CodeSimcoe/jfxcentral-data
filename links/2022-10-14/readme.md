* [**Gluon**](https://twitter.com/GluonHQ/) announced the release of **Gluon Scene Builder 19**. You can get it from [github.com/gluonhq/scenebuilder/releases](https://github.com/gluonhq/scenebuilder/releases/tag/19.0.0).
  * It incorporates JavaFX 19 wich brings lots of improvements, so you benefit [from all these release highlights](https://openjfx.io/highlights/19/).
  * [This tweet shows a video](https://twitter.com/Raumzeitfalle/status/1578692849746718720?t=mNxAaRN22Frjkf6kTfGy-w&s=09) of a bugfix on macOS where copy&paste often resulted in entries doubled after paste. A new preference setting "alternative paste behavior for text input" is available on macOS and is enabled by default.
* Already want to test JavaFX 20 Early Access? It's already [available on the **Gluon** website](https://gluonhq.com/products/javafx/#ea)!
* Up till now, each of the newer JavaFX versions could run with a lower JDK, e.g. JavaFX 17 works with JDK 11. But this will change as [was mentioned on the mailinglist](https://mail.openjdk.org/pipermail/openjfx-dev/2022-October/036089.html): "JavaFX 20 requires JDK 17 or later." 
* [**Abhinay Agarwal**](https://twitter.com/iAbhinay) shared a few very interesting JavaFX links:
  * [**edencoding.com**](https://edencoding.com/category/javafx/) has the "Most vibrant collection of JavaFX articles I have come across recently. Kudos to [**Ed Eden-Rump** AKA NerdyEden](https://twitter.com/NerdyEden)."
  * A list created by **Abhinay** himself with all the flags that might help you while debugging a JavaFX application on ["Flags for JavaFX application"](https://abhinay.xyz/javafx/2022/10/03/OpenJFX-flags.html)
* [**Robert Ladst√§tter**](https://twitter.com/rladstaetter) shared a [HelloWorld example project on GitHub](https://github.com/rladstaetter/javafx-advancedinstaller-example) to show how to install a JavaFX app with a Windows Installer using [**Advanced Installer**](https://twitter.com/advinst).
* [**Dirk Lemmermann**](https://twitter.com/dlemmermann) added a new custom control to [**GemsFX**](https://github.com/dlsc-software-consulting-gmbh/GemsFX) for displaying screens and windows of a JavaFX application, inspired by MacOS.
