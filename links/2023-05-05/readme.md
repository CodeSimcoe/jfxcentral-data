* The unstoppable [**OrangoMango** is making great progress with his chess game](https://twitter.com/orango_mango/status/1653797211052945414).
  * And shared a link to the [sources of his 3D engine and the minecraft-clone](https://twitter.com/orango_mango/status/1652974233864085504). 
* 3D and data visualization wizard [**Sean Phillips** shared new screenshots of Trinity](https://twitter.com/SeanMiPhillips/status/1653721465059942401). By colorizing Binary Classification feature space from a deep learning model using Javafx 3D we see decision manifolds have subgroupings. 
  * And an extra one with [Trinity's UMAP projection cluster data maintaining references back to their hyper-dimensional vectors and imagery](https://twitter.com/SeanMiPhillips/status/1653492689193644032). This demonstrates anchoring 2D nodes to Shape3D nodes as the PerspectiveCamera is rotated.
  * Too complex to understand? I agree, but his work is just amazing and really mind-blowing ;-)
  * If you want to know more about it, this is a link to an interview of December: ["Visualizing Brain Computer Interface Data Using JavaFX"](https://foojay.io/today/visualizing-brain-computer-interface-data-using-javafx/)
  * And in those tweets he announced Trinity will be available soon on Github!
* Help! [**Almas Baim** is doing strange teleportation things with the Java Duke](https://twitter.com/AlmasBaim/status/1652066132872896512)...
* It seems GraalVM is going to [announce some JavaFX related news with the next feature release, expected on June 13th](https://twitter.com/shaunmsmith/status/1651621631322726413).
* [**Homebookner** shared SANEScanFX, a scanner application](https://twitter.com/Heimbuchner_J/status/1653019966453473280), not finished yet but already usable.
