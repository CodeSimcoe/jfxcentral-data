* JavaFX 19 just got released a few weeks ago, but [**Johan Vos**](https://twitter.com/johanvos) is already [looking forward](https://twitter.com/johanvos/status/1575159889994911744?t=PJn2au0k_icq2qseeLVOXA&s=09) to the next one: *a really-worth-mentioning improvement that will be in JavaFX 20 is the update to MarlinFX 0.9.4.6 by [**Laurent Bourgès**](https://twitter.com/laurent_bourges). Thank you very much Laurent for your contributions. They are an important part to the success of JavaFX. See [JDK-8287604](https://bugs.openjdk.org/browse/JDK-8287604).*
  * [Laurent is even sharing his TODO list on GitHub](https://github.com/users/bourgesl/projects/1/views/1) in case you are curious about what he is working on... 
* [**Dirk Lemmermann**](https://twitter.com/dlemmermann) announced [in a tweet](https://twitter.com/dlemmermann/status/1576974458761486338) version 11.12.1 of CalendarFX with new views for displaying resource allocations, improved editing behaviour, plenty of fixes and enhancements. You can [find it on GitHub](https://github.com/dlsc-software-consulting-gmbh/CalendarFX), and new link for the [documentation is here](https://dlsc-software-consulting-gmbh.github.io/CalendarFX/).
* [**Robert Ladstätter**](https://twitter.com/rladstaetter) wanted to use JavaFX on a Windows aarch64 (virtual) machine, and [described the process to build it from the sources](http://ladstatt.blogspot.com/2022/10/a-javafx-fanboy-forgets-about-his.html).
* [**Almas Baim**](https://twitter.com/AlmasBaim/status/1576154186315882496) shared [a video in a tweet](https://twitter.com/AlmasBaim/status/1576154186315882496) showing a bridge generated with FXGL (game engine) to illustrate a distance joint (which constrains two entities to preserve their distance to each other) that produces some interesting results. Entities with different densities are thrown at it and fly through the screen using physics.
* [**Chad Preisler**](https://twitter.com/cpreisler) shared [a video showing how to create a form using SceneBuilder and JavaFX](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auao5UNrUcg), getting the form to resize the correct way.
* [OrangoMango](https://twitter.com/orango_mango) shared a [project to visualize and solve a Rubik's Cube with JavaFX](https://github.com/OrangoMango/RubikCube), that is also available as an Android APK. It's inspired by a [similar example created by Gluon](https://github.com/gluonhq/gluon-samples/tree/master/rubiks-cube).
* Devoxx Belgium is next week (10-14 October) and the organization is [thanking Gluon in a tweet](https://twitter.com/Devoxx/status/1577934708100456448) for their continued support for the #OSS Devoxx mobile app. Sources of the DevoxxBadges JavaFX app [are available on GitHub](https://github.com/gluonhq/DevoxxBadges).
* New content on jfx-central.com:
  * Real World App: [JabRef](https://www.jfx-central.com/real_world/jabref) is an open-source, cross-platform citation and reference management tool, see [jabref.org](https://www.jabref.org/).
  * Tool: ["Conveyor"](https://www.jfx-central.com/tools/conveyor) by [**Hydraulic**](https://twitter.com/HydraulicCorp), is an alternative/replacement for the jpackage tool but with support for (background) updates, signing, notarisation.
  * Another library by [**Pedro Duque Vieira**](https://twitter.com/P_Duke): [FXParallax](https://www.jfx-central.com/libraries/fxparallax). This framework adds controls to add Parallax effects to JavaFX application, this effect can add a sense of depth (3D like) to where it’s used.
  * Coming soon... [**Florian Kirmaier**](https://twitter.com/FlorianKirmaier) is pimping the jfx-central website to make it much faster very soon. Due to the architecture of [jpro.one](https://www.jpro.one/), scrolling in a ScrollPane requires server calls (as the JavaFX app lives on the server). A custom skin, should bring a solution...
