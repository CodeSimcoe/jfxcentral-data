## JavaFX Games

* [**Johan Vos** stumbled into this addictive web game, written in JavaFX by **Gerrit Grunwald** using WebFX: tetris.webfx.dev](https://foojay.social/@johanvos@mastodon.social/110461937691524803).
  It's great to see how developers are using JavaFX to make cool stuff.
* [**OrangoMango** made Snake v1.0 available on itch](https://twitter.com/orango_mango/status/1662758757506469889). Thanks to WebFX, there is now a web version that is playable in the browser (fullscreen is recommended).

## JavaFX Components, Libraries, Tools

## Tutorials

* **Coding Examples** uploaded new videos to "JavaFX 3D Tutorials". For example: ["Animation | Fade Transition", to create a Text and make it blink using the FadeTransition class](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YSor8d3Hzk). using the shape's transparency to achieve the required effect.
