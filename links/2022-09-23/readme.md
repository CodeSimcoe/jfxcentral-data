  * [**Johan Vos**](https://twitter.com/johanvos) added [the message](https://twitter.com/johanvos/status/1569682888915836928): "*We did our first JavaFX release in September 2018 (JavaFX 11). We planned a 6-months cadence, similar to the JDK releases. Four years later, we still keep the train moving forward. It takes blood, sweat and tears, but seeing what developers are doing with JavaFX makes it worth.*"
  * With [a very nice reply](https://twitter.com/errcraft/status/1569727660032692230) of [**James Gosling**](https://twitter.com/errcraft) (the [father of Java!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Gosling)): "*Wonderful!  I’m a happy JavaFX user. Thanks for all the wonderful work you do.*"
* [**Pedro Duque Vieira**](https://twitter.com/P_Duke) released a new version of JMetro, a JavaFX theme composed by a set of controls, stylesheets and skins, inspired by the Fluent Design System and adapted to fit the JavaFX SDK. There are also changes that have been made according to Pedro's opinions on some of Fluent Design’s particularities.
