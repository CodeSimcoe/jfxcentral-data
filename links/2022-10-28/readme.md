* On September 30, [**Gail Anderson**](https://twitter.com/gail_asgteach) was speaking on IntelliJ IDEA Conference about "JavaFX for Mobile Development". We promised here to share the link to the video when available, and [here it is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8epeIFdKWo&t=14498s).
* [**Sean Phillips**](https://twitter.com/SeanMiPhillips) shared several videos with an impressive data visualization tool.
  * [Arcing through decoded hyper-dimensional space using #Java and #JavaFX](https://twitter.com/SeanMiPhillips/status/1584287746637828098).

* [**Jakob Jenkov**]() asked [in this tweet with a lot of interesting replies](https://twitter.com/jjenkov/status/1584090714320695296): "Hi JavaFXers - do we have some JavaFX application design patterns somewhere? Advice about how to structure a #Java + #JavaFX application so the code base and application does not get messy as the app grows? I have some ideas -but I'd like to see what the rest of you have too :-)"
* [**WebFX**](https://twitter.com/WebFXProject) seems to have a fixed spot in this weekly list... [This new demo](https://webfx.dev/#/demos) shows MediaView added to the JavaFX Media emulation, which means that WebFX can now display videos.
