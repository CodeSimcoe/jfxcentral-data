* A lot of the Links Of The Week are found on Twitter. But for a few weeks that medium lost a lot of its fun (in my opinion) since the take-over by Musk. So I'm slowly moving to Mastodon as my new "source of truth and inspiration". And then it's fun to [discover an (old) Mastodon client application](https://bigshoulders.city/@wakingrufus/109344242897231710) in Kotlin and TornadoFX by [**wakingrufus**](https://bigshoulders.city/@wakingrufus). You can [find it on GitHub](https://github.com/wakingrufus/mastodon-jfx). It probably needs some updates, but it could be the start of something fun. Take a look!
* [**Robert Ladst√§tter**](https://twitter.com/rladstaetter), creator of LogoRRR, is looking for help: ["How can you extract time instant information from log files"](https://github.com/rladstaetter/LogoRRR/issues/12).
* [**Thanhpv**](https://twitter.com/realThanhpv) shared some [first screenshots of a new JavaFX application](https://twitter.com/realThanhpv/status/1590309382902149121) to quickly and accurately build visualized and transparent construction quantity reports for resource planning, cost estimation, risk management.,... To be continued...
* [**JavaFX3D**](https://twitter.com/JavaFX3D) again shared a lot of interesting projects. One we want to include here is a [video showing a Space Invaders game](https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=1337&v=jCBBCBCUt9E&feature=youtu.be) by [**Charles T. (A Bit's Odyssey)**](https://www.youtube.com/@chalodss) (explanation in French).
* Found on reddit: 
   * A [simple periodic table app for chemistry lovers on GitHub](https://github.com/AmirAli-AZ/PeriodicTable) by **AmirAli**, based on this [periodic table JSON](https://github.com/Bowserinator/Periodic-Table-JSON).
   * [**Dave Barret**](https://twitter.com/Polypragmatist) has a lot of very nice tutorials on his site! For instance ["An Introduction to Model-View-Controller-Interactor"](https://www.pragmaticcoding.ca/javafx/Mvci-Introduction).
   * [jWin](https://github.com/SDIDSA/jwin) by **Zinelabidine Teyar**: a Java tool that compiles and packs your app as a Windows installer.
