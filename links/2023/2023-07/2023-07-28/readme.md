This list with #LinksOfTheWeek skipped a few weeks since July 7th, because of busy schedules, holiday interruptions, and too few hours in a day... But here we are with a wrap up of July.

Expect the next #LinksOfTheWeek at the end of August, so it will be actually a #LinksOfTheMonth... ;-)

## Core

* Early-Access Builds of JavaFX 21 are available from
  * [jdk.java.net](https://jdk.java.net/javafx21/)
  * [gluonhq.com](https://gluonhq.com/products/javafx/)
  * *JavaFX 21-ea is designed to work with JDK 21-ea, but it is known to work with JDK 17 and later versions*.
* And JavaFX 22 Early-Access Builds, Build 1 is [also available](https://jdk.java.net/javafx22/)!
  
## Applications

* [**OrangoMango** is working on a logic simulator](https://twitter.com/orango_mango/status/1683512470466437121) with simple AND and NOT gates.
* [**Tobias Briones** is working on an example application and blog](https://twitter.com/tobiasbriones_/status/1680117927662501888): "Building Slides from Screenshots App in JavaFX".
* [**Sean Phillips** whipped up a Trinity easter egg for our DALLE demos](https://twitter.com/SeanMiPhillips/status/1679498134974595072). Each time services request a DALLE image, it is copied to network share. Walle Dalle scans that shared directory. Each time a new image file is copied it is animated into a spot in the 3D ring.
  * And on Mastodon he shared more [Trinity screenshots](https://foojay.social/@Birdasaur@jvm.social).
* [**Mark J Koch** is writing an application for EagleCAD schematics](https://mastodon.social/@maehem/110743557437273863): "Still lots of work to do (like view and print PC board files) but this is a wonderful milestone in my development of this app. Hope to open source it in about a month or two." #EagleCAD #JavaFX #opensource]"
  * His first experiments he shared, [looked more like "generative art"](https://mastodon.social/@maehem/110708951041214410).

## Games

* [**WebFX** made FoodDice, created by **OrangoMango** available online](https://twitter.com/WebFXProject/status/1676576239258042368). You can play it on [fooddice.webfx.dev](https://fooddice.webfx.dev/).
* [**Almas Baim** sees that FXGL is getting some interest on GitHub recently](https://twitter.com/AlmasBaim/status/1679096264988696576).The next release (21) will match Java / JavaFX 21. What would you like to see supported?
* [**OrangoMango** coded a game in 48h for the GMTK game jam](https://twitter.com/orango_mango/status/1678428149233639424). If you get to the boss, let him know (It could be difficult).

## Components, Libraries, Tools

* [**Gluon** is launching GluonFX](https://techhub.social/@gluonhq/110786277544214779): "A growing set of JavaFX tools/components that we maintain on github, targeting all platforms. GPL license, free for developers. If you use them in a commercial product, we have licenses for that as well". See [gluonhq.com/introducing-gluonfx](https://gluonhq.com/introducing-gluonfx/).
  * [**Johan Vos** adds](https://twitter.com/johanvos/status/1684563837188739072): "Streamlining our software, adding consistency in approach, on github (e.g. badges, javadoc, maven approach), and licensing. Gradually, more of our software will be in this umbrella, and it will work on all platforms -- including mobile."

## Podcast, Video, Books

* [**Frank Delporte** discovered that an image he created for his book "Getting Started with Java on the Raspberry Pi" with a JavaFX application](https://foojay.social/@frankdelporte/110790391834861143) is used in the 2nd edition of "The Definitive Guide to Modern Java Clients with JavaFX 17" by **Stephen Chin**, **Johan Vos**, **Jeames Weaver**, and many others.

  * And he has been [working on a #JavaFX custom SortedList to overcome some performance issues](https://twitter.com/cpreisler/status/1683207830910693376) in couple applications. Links to the code are in the video description.
