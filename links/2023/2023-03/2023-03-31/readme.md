* Last week Java and JavaFX 20 were released, but you can already start experimenting with JavaFX 21 Early-Access Builds!
  * Get it from [Gluon](https://gluonhq.com/products/javafx/).
  * Or [OpenJDK](https://mastodon.social/@openjdk/110078557118569030).
* [**Steve Hannah** shared a GitHub action](https://twitter.com/shannah78/status/1605922584310452225) to generate native installers for Java desktop apps.
* The 3D engine of **OrangoMango** has now [Minecraft-like trees](https://twitter.com/orango_mango/status/1639660431160532993).
* [SmartFinder by **Serendipity** version 1.7.3 now runs with JavaFX 20](https://twitter.com/SerendigityInfo/status/1639293098227388416)! It's a Desktop Search Tool APP fully developed with Java and JavaFX technology.
* **Almas Baim** has been very active on Twitter the last week...
  * [Announcing version 17.3 of FXGL](https://twitter.com/AlmasBaim/status/1641412978992902144): improve A* performance, isometric support for .tmx, 3D updates (lookAt, direction, rotation, .obj models), propertyMap convenience API.
  * [Pathfinding solution added to FXGL that outperforms the existing one by up to 80%](https://twitter.com/AlmasBaim/status/1639608367516729349), by replacing ArrayList with HashSet in critical code.
  * [Another video with the FXGL engine pathfinding in action](https://twitter.com/AlmasBaim/status/1639349553496293377). This demo shows large red areas that are not passable, while dynamic entities are ignored and can be passed through.
  * [Video showing physics sandboxes are never not fun](https://twitter.com/AlmasBaim/status/1639017161455960064)! You can now pick up any entity as seen in this sample.
  * [Video of text animations with particles](https://twitter.com/AlmasBaim/status/1639804091609088002).
  * [Video with particles, one as "lead"](https://twitter.com/AlmasBaim/status/1640102122350944257), and other particles following with min and max distance, ensuring all particles are connected while the lead moves.
  * [Isometric tile support in FXGL has had significant interest over the years](https://twitter.com/AlmasBaim/status/1640474477258760192). The maths looks straightforward but the architecture, as per usual, will need some careful pondering.
  * [Screenshot of initial progress towards having first-class support for isometric levels](https://twitter.com/AlmasBaim/status/1640802453288353792) in FXGL.
  * [Video showing the new sliders in FXGL](https://twitter.com/AlmasBaim/status/1641582312730030082).
* And another regular guest of the LinksOfTheWeek... **Dirk Lemmermann**
  * [TableView replacement based on GridPane. No virtualisation](https://twitter.com/dlemmermann/status/1640703431638753283). Very useful for small datasets. Will be added to GemsFX very soon.
  * [Screenshot of an answer on GitHub explaining there is only one codebase](https://twitter.com/dlemmermann/status/1640636273239916547) for jfxcentral website and desktop app, thanks to [@jpro_one](https://twitter.com/jpro_one).
  * [The TimePicker in GemsFX has been improved by @cpreisler](https://twitter.com/dlemmermann/status/1639262929752129544). It can now also display and edit seconds and milliseconds.
  * [He's looking back at something he implemented almost 20 years ago with Java 5 and Swing](https://twitter.com/dlemmermann/status/1641025184248348672), and it still works perfectly nowadays with Java 19 ... just a whole lot faster!
