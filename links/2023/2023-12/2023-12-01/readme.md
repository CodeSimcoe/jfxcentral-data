## Applications

This is only [one of his recent messages](https://twitter.com/rnartist_app/status/1730530572227764240): "If the #RNA 2D layout selected at first doesn't fit your needs, RNArtist will provide you a new panel to compute and preview alternate layouts."

## Games

* **Almas Baim** is working on new features for FXGL: 
  * "The current version of the #FXGL engine can only show up to 5 dialogue options. The next version will use a scroll bar, where needed, to show any number of options, [as can be seen in the demo](https://twitter.com/AlmasBaim/status/1730336323750224104)."
  * "Adding NPCs that can act as companions somehow instantly makes it [more interesting to explore the world](https://twitter.com/AlmasBaim/status/1730000612777976047)."
* **OrangoMango** published a [trailer of RailTheWay on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAunQTTsbio): "A game made in Java/JavaFX without the use of any game engine. Guide the trains to their station. Each train has a color that represents its destination. Sometimes there are some cargo trains that disturb you, try to let them go away and be sure to avoid the cars on your way!"
