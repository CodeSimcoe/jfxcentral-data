This is the final LinksOfTheWeek for 2023. It was an amazing year with many evolutions in Java and JavaFX and a complete "fresh" version of JFX Central. Thanks for following these updates and looking forward to more of your JavaFX work in the new year...

## Core

* A little [insight into the OpenJFX project by **Johan Vos**](https://mastodon.social/@johanvos/111596707584064200): "We often get requests about 'Why don't you provide a JavaFX build for this or that platform?' The short answer: it's easy to create a one-time build with some parameters, but it's hard to maintain. And expensive. Our AWS bill is impressive. And since all our OpenJFX builds are available for free, this is really a major cost for us."

## Applications

* **Patrik Karlstr√∂m** is [updating rsync GUI, an application he wrote in 2015](https://twitter.com/PatrikKarlstrom/status/1737534168043552769): "Today I ran my first #backup with the next version based on NetBeans Platform and JavaFX. Still very rough around the edges though."

## Games

* [**London Softworks**](https://twitter.com/LondonSoftworks) is building a custom 2D game engine in Java and shares the progress in various tweets.
* **Frank Delporte** published ["A JavaFX Game Application in a Single Java File with JBang and FXGL"](https://webtechie.be/post/2023-12-14-jbang-fxgl/). A video walk-through together with **Almas Baim** will follow soon...

## Tutorials

* A new tutorial by [**Dave Barrett**](https://twitter.com/Polypragmatist): "An [introduction to ListView](https://www.pragmaticcoding.ca/javafx/elements/listview-basics) and understanding how to use it to display something more than just lists of Strings."

## Miscellaneous

* [**Gail Anderson** has a call for all JavaFX developers](https://twitter.com/gail_asgteach/status/1736836965683892661): "Please let the GraalVM team know that JavaFX and mobile is important by [filling out this survey](https://graalvm.typeform.com/survey?typeform-source=t.co)."

## JFX Central

* Last week we announced the new Learn section on JFX Central. This week several tutorials were added to the "Learn JavaFX" section, with content provided by [**Edward Nyirenda Jr.**](https://www.jfx-central.com/people/e.nyirenda):
