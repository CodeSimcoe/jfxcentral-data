* **Michael Schnell** created a [JavaFX CDI Example](https://github.com/fuinorg/javafx-cdi-example) project (Java 17 with "jakarta" namespace, Maven build, GitHub build, Sub controllers, Blocking UI, About dialog, Exception dialog, TestFX unit test). There is also a [JavaFX CDI Archetype](https://github.com/fuinorg/javafx-cdi-archetype) based on it that allows easily bootstrapping your own project.
