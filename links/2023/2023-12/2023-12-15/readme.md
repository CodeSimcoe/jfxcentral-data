Here are the new links, and make sure to read till the end as we have some fascinating new content here on JFX Central!

## Applications

* A new teaser [video by **Alessio Vinerbi** of MoonsonFX](https://twitter.com/Alessio_Vinerbi/status/1733534005792805267), a JavaFX animation tool.
* **Heshan Kariyawasam** shared some nice projects again!
  * A [JavaFX-based statistical calculator](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7139904558327099392/): "Quickly compute mean, median, mode, and variance with an intuitive user interface."
  * A [Dynamic Background Demo](https://github.com/heshanthenura/DynamicBackground) that dynamically adjusts the background image to fit the screen dimensions. It utilizes JavaFX's Stage and ImageView components to create a responsive background. The app also includes functionality to open a new window, demonstrating basic window management in JavaFX. The video shows a cool use of multiple windows in one application.
  * And on Foojay.io, his first blog was published: [Creating Executables For JavaFX Applications](https://foojay.io/today/creating-executables-for-javafx-applications/): "Let's take a look in this article at the current state of what can be done with jpackage and GitHub Actions to create executables for JavaFX applications."

## Games

* [**Almas Baim** shared a new proof-of-concept of the node inspector panel](https://twitter.com/AlmasBaim/status/1734865416697114945) in FXGL, which allows editing various node properties: "This way each dialogue node in the main UI just captures the text associated with it and reduces visual clutter".

## Podcast, Video, Books

* In the [third part of the Foojay J-Fall Report Podcast](https://foojay.io/today/foojay-podcast-36/), [**Gerrit Grunwald**](https://www.jfx-central.com/people/g.grunwald) and [**Anthony Goubard**](https://twitter.com/Anthony_Goubard) talk about desktop application development with Java.

## Tutorials

* [**shiratsuyudachi** asked ChatGPT](https://twitter.com/shiratsuyudachi/status/1734874003100364858) to create a minimal JavaFX application.

## Miscellaneous

* **Michael Schnell** created a [JavaFX CDI Example](https://github.com/fuinorg/javafx-cdi-example) project (Java 17 with "jakarta" namespace, Maven build, GitHub build, Sub controllers, Blocking UI, About dialog, Exception dialog, TestFX unit test). There is also a [JavaFX CDI Archetype](https://github.com/fuinorg/javafx-cdi-archetype) based on it that allows easily bootstrapping your own project.
* [**Divyanshu Yadav** needs some serious UI suggestions](https://twitter.com/DVyadav2307/status/1735285920885277156)...
* **Dirk Lemmermann** now has an ["official JavaFX" office](https://twitter.com/dlemmermann/status/1734941451971182773).

## JFX Central
