## Core

* [Rampdown Phase 1 (RDP1) for JavaFX 21 starts on July 13, 2023 at 16:00 UTC (09:00 Pacific time)](https://twitter.com/OpenJDK/status/1669074682505572353), about four weeks from now.
* JavaFX 21 Early-Access Builds Build 21 are available from [jdk.java.net/javafx21](https://jdk.java.net/javafx21/), addressing [these issues](https://bugs.openjdk.org/browse/JDK-8301312?jql=project%20%3D%20JDK%20AND%20fixversion%20%3D%20jfx21%20and%20component%20%3D%20javafx%20and%20%22resolved%20in%20build%22%20%3D%20b21%20order%20by%20component%2C%20subcomponent). JavaFX 21-ea is designed to work with JDK 21-ea, but it is known to work with JDK 17 and later versions.
* [**Johan Vos** is planning to spend more time on Java on Mobile (OpenJDK Mobile)](https://mastodon.social/@johanvos/110547534890057649) in the near future: "There is 0 support from big tech because they fall in 2 categories: 1/ they have no revenue on mobile, 2/ they have competing OS tech that drives devs/users to their revenue-driven cloud services. But since I'm not big tech, I can just do it."

## Applications

* After [teasing us](https://twitter.com/SeanMiPhillips/status/1669087717743788033) for a few weeks, it finally happened! [**Sean Phillips** announced](https://twitter.com/SeanMiPhillips/status/1669089367694901250) that Trinity, an Explainable AI Analysis and Visualization tool written in Java and JavaFX, is now officially public and open source. His message: "Have fun you fine young cannibals."
  * Video demo of Trinity to [project and distinguish between human and chatGPT altered text blurbs](https://twitter.com/SeanMiPhillips/status/1668296662857424896).
  * With many thanks to [**JavaFX 3D**, **Jasper Potts**, **Alexander Kouznetsov**, **Chien Yang**, **Kevin Rushforth**, **Richard Bair**, and many others ](https://twitter.com/JavaFX3D/status/1669523111484719105) for all their hard work on JavaFX and 3D and more!

## Games

* Another [JavaFX game has been ported to the Web with **WebFX** Food Dice!](https://twitter.com/WebFXProject/status/1668227539154747396). It's a plain JavaFX game written for the GMTK Game jam 2022 and was coded in 48h from scratch with no 3rd party lib. Congrats to the 16 years old author **OrangoMango**. Play online on [fooddice.webfx.dev](https://fooddice.webfx.dev).

## Components, Libraries, Tools

* [**Dirk Lemmermann** sees there truly is a big need for custom window decorations and found an extra one](https://twitter.com/dlemmermann/status/1669473442163294210).

## Podcast, Videos,...

* [**Gerrit Grunwald** and **Ixchel Ruiz** talking at JNation](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7071865436115468288/) about Graphical User Interfaces with Java.

## Tutorials

* Not new, but a nice reminder by [**Jakob Jenkov**: "I have a tutorial covering a lot of the basics of JavaFX"](https://twitter.com/jjenkov/status/1666472122535886849).

## Miscellaneous

* [A help request on Reddit to build a JavaFX project in VsCode](https://www.reddit.com/r/JavaFX/comments/1483fio/need_help_building_javafx_project_in_vscode/).

## JFX-Central

* After many iterations, [**Dirk Lemmermann** found the perfect new logo](https://twitter.com/dlemmermann/status/1669026529429397521): "Work on the logo for the JFX-Central website is finished. In the end large, small, color, black, white, etc.... versions were needed to make it look code in all places."
* Finding out what's coming to the next JavaFX release [will be super easy by visiting the new OpenJFX page on JFX-Central](https://twitter.com/dlemmermann/status/1668690954876755974).
* Finding that one library you recently heard about [will be easy via JFX-Central... and  who wrote it, and videos showing it, and the repo coordinates, and and and](https://twitter.com/dlemmermann/status/1669472701059047424).
* And the new desktop version will [come with its own custom stage when running on desktop](https://twitter.com/dlemmermann/status/1667169729784545280).
