## Do you want to contribute to JFX-Central?

We have been very busy working on the new JFX-Central version... Maybe you want to help out? [The repository is now public](https://github.com/dlemmermann/jfxcentral2)! Feel free to make contributions. Testing, reporting bugs. All is very welcome.

## Core

* [**Gluon** asks all JavaFX developers to give JavaFX 21-ea+21 a try](https://twitter.com/GluonHQ/status/1671461934049243136).

## Applications

* [**Christopher Schnick** gave the welcome page of v1.2 of XPipe some personality](https://twitter.com/crschnick/status/1672101399486951425).
* And here is Trinity again...
  * [**Sean Phillips** shared a screenshot](https://twitter.com/SeanMiPhillips/status/1671682955855446016): projecting decision manifolds from Pilot Assist AI Models for dog fighting pilots. 
  * [Rendering a rainbow highway](https://twitter.com/SeanMiPhillips/status/1671674205098704899).
  * [**Johan Vos** is still impressed by the Devnexs keynote given by Sean](https://mastodon.social/@johanvos/110566790213698291): "This is a very cool demonstration about Trinity, an open-source tool developed/used at John Hopkins University. It shows how Java developers can create cool, amazing and extremely useful stuff with great visualization using JavaFX."
* [**Dirk Lemmermann** really likes the latest version of the sample app for AtlantaFX](https://twitter.com/dlemmermann/status/1670757586260377602): "Very nicely polished theme and controls. Packaged with Conveyor from HydraulicDev."
* [**Maciek Gorywoda** shared v1.0.0 FxCalculator](https://twitter.com/makingthematrix/status/1669374799246774278): "It's, well, a calculator for your Android phone." Read the whole thread to learn more, e.g. that it's written in Scala 3.3, JavaFX, Gluon, and built with GraalVM Native Image.
* [**Jamie Macaulay** is working on SUDUnpacker](https://twitter.com/jam_machund/status/1671102745309265920) to handle SoundTraps sud files.

## Games

* [**OrangoMango** shared a video showing collision detection with convex shapes](https://twitter.com/orango_mango/status/1671252291658055680). It resulted in a nice chat with  [**Sean Phillips**](https://twitter.com/SeanMiPhillips/status/1671662634930696195) and [**Carl Dea**](https://twitter.com/carldea/status/1672041067909193734).
* [**Almas Baim** shows image mesh warping](https://twitter.com/AlmasBaim/status/1671169432524316674): "No specific use case, but I'm sure this will come in handy for some cool effects in the future."

## Podcast

* [Foojay Podcast #25: Game Development with Java, JavaFX, and FXGL](https://foojay.io/today/foojay-podcast-25/). **Chengen Zhao**, **Almas Baim**, **Gerrit Grunwald** talk with **Frank Delporte** about why Java should be on your game-development-language-list.

## JFX-Central, the New Version

* Several improvements for the app version of the new JFX-Central:
  * [A couple of screens were added for a nice bootstrap sequence](https://twitter.com/dlemmermann/status/1670798362453368840). When running the app for the first time it will clone its data repo (takes a while). Any launch after that will perform an update on it (fast).
  * [It will also come with a tray icon for quick access to anything JavaFX](https://twitter.com/dlemmermann/status/1671506280026972164)
  * [It is now an even better citizen when running on Mac](https://twitter.com/dlemmermann/status/1671538241952948228). Can you spot the difference aka the "dots"?
