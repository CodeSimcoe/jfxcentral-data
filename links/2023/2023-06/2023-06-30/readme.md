Service call to all the people who have "something" on JFX-Central (library, book, tutorial,...). We are reviewing all
info on the website in preparation of the new JFX-Central version. But we need your help, please contact us or make a
pull request in [jfxcentral-data](https://github.com/dlsc-software-consulting-gmbh/jfxcentral-data) to make sure all the
info is still correct and up-to-date. Thanks!

## Core

* [**Gluon** is working on making our JavaFX software (libraries, tools, components) more consistent and developer-friendly](https://techhub.social/@gluonhq/110615181663234520): "Over the past years, we learned a lot, and we're putting that experience now in our code."
* [**Dirk Lemmermann** is looking for help with a Webkit issue in JavaFX 18.0.1](https://github.com/dlsc-software-consulting-gmbh/GMapsFX/issues/204).
* [**Abdelrahman Bayoumi**](https://twitter.com/Abdelrahman_B1) explores a solution to resolve the challenges when it comes to [rendering Arabic, being a right-to-left script](https://dev.to/abdelrahmanbayoumi/arabic-text-rendering-issues-in-javafx-3j9i).

## Games

* [**OrangoMango** added a teleport stone, a propeller and rotating platforms to FoodDice](https://twitter.com/orango_mango/status/1673693403664764938). New levels with those new items are coming in the next update. Also implemented the new collision system that he wrote before for these new rotating items.
  * And he has been [experimenting with a physics engine made from scratch](https://twitter.com/orango_mango/status/1672648493372981249). Right now, there are just some basic physics laws and chains.
* [**Almas Baim** is drawing circles with triangles and FXGL](https://twitter.com/AlmasBaim/status/1673700044556386304).

## Components, Libraries, Tools

* [**Jaroslav Tulach** is discussing JavaFX Lite](https://twitter.com/JaroslavTulach/status/1449827890300915718) and is asking for feedback: "Would you find #javafxlight - e.g. coding in #javafx & rendering via #HTML5 useful?"

## Tutorials

* In French: [**Jason Champagne** has a series of videos, part 2](https://twitter.com/jachampagne8/status/1674085894700113921): "Point essentiel en JavaFX sur l'architecture des différents composants, en particulier le Scene Graph et la gestion des fenêtres (stages)".
* Not new, but just discovered: [Video series by **Jaret Wright** to create a JavaFX Memory Game](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guXTwZpGVRk&list=PLoodc-fmtJNbeL8P1DizFcgjp62UjvJ3t).

## JFX-Central

* [**Lee Wyatt**, one of the main contributors to the new JFX-Central version](https://twitter.com/dlemmermann/status/1672975213376552964) added a "Credits" page, one of the many pages he created and/or improved.
