* [**Gluon** announced public access to its JavaFX 17 builds](https://twitter.com/GluonHQ/status/1623680620315529216), including 17.0.6 and subsequent versions.
  * With an important note regarding version compatibility: "As the development of JavaFX 20 picks up momentum, it’s important to note a key change – JavaFX 20 will require Java 17 or later."
  * [**Johan Vos** of Gluon also shared](https://twitter.com/johanvos/status/1623958106387410945): "Gluon leverages GraalVM in Gluon Substrate, allowing JavaFX apps to be converted into native client apps for desktop, mobile and embedded."
* [**Frank Delporte** shared it is still a long way to go, but Lottie4J can now read both fixed and animated beziers](https://twitter.com/FrankDelporte/status/1622870327301746688). It includes a screenshot of the very first result of a loaded animation with colors, strokes, fills... being the next step.
  * And shared a [link to an article](https://foojay.social/@lottie4j/109839719108396708) why it could become important to have a JavaFX implementation of LottieFiles: "4.7 Million Motion Graphics Designers and Developers Turn to Lottie for Efficient Animation Workflow."
* [**JabRef** now has a dark theme created by **Joel Maximilian Mai**](https://foojay.social/@jabref/109836297203164251).
* [**Dave Barrett** is a big fan of JavaFX + Kotlin](https://twitter.com/Polypragmatist/status/1623457419404914690): "it's a match made in heaven.  Kotlin gives you the tools to streamline your layout code in ways you never could in Java."
* [**Chad Preisler** shared a 5 minute about property binding](https://twitter.com/cpreisler/status/1623174913891659777): "JavaFX makes getting data from your form controls into your model very easy.".
* [**ParrotMan** shared a project created 2 years ago](https://twitter.com/ParrotMan18/status/1621884694081204225): "I made the soundtracks, pixel art sprites, and almost all of the underlying systems from scratch. It looks janky as heck but it was a worthwhile learning experience."
* Regular guest of the LinksOfTheWeek, [**WhiteWoodCity**, shows the use of VFX components to decorate a JavaFX application](https://twitter.com/WhiteWoodCity/status/1622774096957431808) with a link to video and sources.
* [**GZYanKui** share a video with a game](https://twitter.com/YangKui7/status/1622748759309570050).
* [**Gerrit Grunwald** spent previous weekend with some JArkanoid coding](https://twitter.com/hansolo_/status/1621905556075077634).
  * [JArkanoid levels 4 - 7](https://twitter.com/hansolo_/status/1621905661012353025).
  * [And will build it with GitHub Actions](https://twitter.com/hansolo_/status/1622151570119852033).
  * [Plus a warning about the JavaFX Canvas being really nice and fast, but](https://twitter.com/hansolo_/status/1621651332011642881) "be beware of effects... Using one simple dropshadow in a GraphicsContext can really bring down performance... Just as a reminder."
  * And his [JDKMon application got downloaded 10k times](https://twitter.com/hansolo_/status/1623028117219450881)!
* [**Almas Baim** is practising his "summing skills"](https://twitter.com/AlmasBaim/status/1621649400052211715).
* [**OrangoMango** made a rotating light that simulates the sun](https://twitter.com/orango_mango/status/1621578572895854595), only with matrices and vectors in a self-made 3D engine.
* [**Dirk Lemmermann** is facing another nice design challenge for his CRM for the energy market](https://twitter.com/dlemmermann/status/1621512306311200769).
* [**Frank Greco** plans to create a JavaFX ChatGPT application this weekend](https://twitter.com/frankgreco/status/1623701464362229760).
* Not directly JavaFX related, but nice to know... [**Heinz Kabutz** shared graphs](https://mastodon.social/@HeinzKabutz/109799634014176668) showing that a lot of the work in recent Java versions was to stabilize and improve the platform, rather than just adding hundreds of new classes. The number of lines of code might even decrease in the future.
