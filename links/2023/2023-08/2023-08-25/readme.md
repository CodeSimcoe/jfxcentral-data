Tataratataaaaa! Welcome to the new version of jfx-central.com! A complete new home for "all things JavaFX" thanks to the amazing work of a whole [team of JavaFX enthousiast](https://www.jfx-central.com/team). Indeed, yes, it's a website but actually a JavaFX application, so you can also run it as a desktop app. And what's even more important... the [full sources are available on GitHub](https://github.com/dlemmermann/jfxcentral2).

I've taken a holiday this month, so probably missed a lot of the amazing JavaFX news, but still some things caught my attention...

## Applications

* [**Mark Baird** is working on a weather station](https://github.com/mbcoder/weather-station) with Pi4j, Medusa gauges, and JavaFX to show humidity and temperature on a Raspberry Pi.
* [**Robert Ladst√§tter** announced v23.2.1 of LogoRRR](https://github.com/rladstaetter/LogoRRR/releases/tag/23.2.1), a tool to explore log files. One of the important changes is the addition of calls to JNI / Swift to activate security scoped bookmarks for [access to files from the macOS App Sandbox](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/security/app_sandbox/accessing_files_from_the_macos_app_sandbox).
* Check out the [many Trinity update Tweets by Sean Phillips](https://twitter.com/search?q=%40seanmiphillips%20trinity&src=typed_query&f=live). It looks like he didn't take a holiday this summer and went full in to bring more 3D magic and data analysis into his amazing app.
* [**Pedro Duque Vieira** shared a webinar about Hero](https://twitter.com/P_Duke/status/1692525012446572670?s=20): "It's great to see an application I've created along with my client continue to thrive. It's a Java & JavaFX app. Would web tech be a viable option here? I doubt it"
* [**Thanhpv** shared a link to BlueGrid in the Microsoft Store](https://twitter.com/realThanhpv/status/1689464542181400578?s=20): "Real app in real life #Javafx, #Graalvm, #gluonfx: BlueGrid allows engineers, quantity surveyors, auditors, and any ones to perform very exact quantity estimation on PDF, and image files in a concise amount of time."

## Books

* [**Almas Baim** shared a Humble Bundle from Apress](https://twitter.com/AlmasBaim/status/1694403771772588213): 19 books for a ridiculous low price. It includes his book: "Learn JavaFX Game and App Development".

## Tutorials

* [**Johan Vos** created an introduction video on a planned series for Quantum Computing in Java](https://mastodon.social/@johanvos/110886627253715612), and of course he is also using JavaFX.

## Miscellaneous

* Do you want to experiment with JavaFX on the Raspberry Pi? [**Pi4J** has a custom Raspberry Pi OS to make it easy to get started](https://foojay.social/@pi4j/110808004449229039). Thanks to the [FHNW University](https://www.fhnw.ch) and Dieter Holz.
