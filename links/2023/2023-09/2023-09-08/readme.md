JFX Central got further improved after the new version was announced a couple of weeks ago. Bugfixes, faster initial data loading, etc. [**Frank Delporte** wrote a blog post about the history of the project and interviewed](https://webtechie.be/post/2023-09-07-jfxcentral-new-user-interface/) **Dirk Lemmermann**, **Li Wang Yang**, **Florian Kirmaier**, and **Mike Hearn**.

## Applications

* The next version of JDKMon, the tool to keep your Java installations up-to-date, will now also show you the dates of the next OpenJDK update and the next OpenJDK release, [says **Gerrit Grunwald**](https://mastodon.social/@hansolo_/111028113635396197).
* Java 21 is not released yet, but [JabRef is already using it for their new release 5.10](https://foojay.social/@jabref/110994245236386244).

## Components, Libraries, Tools

* A new week, a [new library by **Pedro Duque Vieira**: FXComponents](https://twitter.com/P_Duke/status/1698687283971432648?s=20). It contains a collection of new controls to be used in JavaFX applications.
* **WhiteWoodCity** extended JavaFX, FXGL, and AtlantaFX to reduce function of binding, multiple game scenes supports and navigation of it, enhanced animations, self-made theme. [Check the X thread](https://twitter.com/WhiteWoodCity/status/1697975469965263093?s=20), as he shared the code!
* [**Johan Vos** shared a link to the GitHub project of Rich Text Area](https://twitter.com/johanvos/status/1699335002599649549): "One of the cool GluonHQ tools we are developing/maintaining". 
* [**Carl Dea** is prototyping a new JavaFX-based Dockable windowing library](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/carldea_javafx-activity-7081463432486477824-LCev/).

## Tutorials

* Already shared last week, but he keeps on giving! Check out the tutorials by [**Edward Nyirenda Jr**](https://twitter.com/EdwardAlgorist), all available on his website [coderscratchpad.com](https://coderscratchpad.com/category/computer-programming/javafx/).

## Miscellaneous

* [**Frederic Thevenet** wrote a long thread on Mastodon](https://mastodon.social/@fthevenet/111028413815320945) to explain why "JavaFX is a very solid piece of tech which unfortunately came to maturity at the worst possible time for a "desktop application" GUI framework."
* Looking for a specific icon? Use [JFX Central as **Dirk Lemmermann** explains here](https://twitter.com/dlemmermann/status/1699812103937290590).
* Happy to see more and more references to JavaFX when people discuss app development, like [here by **@t3chn01200**](https://twitter.com/t3chn01200/status/1699016124661121192) , [here by @schramMedia](https://twitter.com/schramMedia/status/1698728406286770422) and [here by @Aman_Raj2241](https://twitter.com/Aman_Raj2241/status/1699840433596297593).
