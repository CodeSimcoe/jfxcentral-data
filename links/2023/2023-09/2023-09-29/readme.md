## Core

* [A message by **Johan Vos**](https://mastodon.social/@johanvos/111121272095237602): "One of the great (non-technical) things about JavaFX is that it is not owned by a single company that tries to use it for its business strategy (e.g. like Google does with most of their "free" stuff). It is really the wide JavaFX ecosystem that drives JavaFX forward, and that allows for pure and honest innovation."
* Last week we had the release of Java and JavaFX 21. This week the [EA (early access) builds of JavaFX 22](https://mastodon.social/@openjdk/111109621684880527)!
  * JavaFX 22 Early-Access Builds Build 10 is here: [jdk.java.net/javafx22](https://jdk.java.net/javafx22/).
  * [Issues addressed in this build](https://bugs.openjdk.org/issues/?jql=project%20%3D%20JDK%20AND%20fixversion%20%3D%20jfx22%20and%20component%20%3d%20javafx%20and%20%22resolved%20in%20build%22%20%3d%20b10%20order%20by%20component%2C%20subcomponent).
  * The proposed schedule for JavaFX 22:
    * RDP1: Jan 11, 2024 (aka “feature freeze”)
    * RDP2: Feb 1, 2024
    * Freeze: Feb 29, 2024
    * GA: Mar 19, 2024
  * JavaFX 22-ea is designed to work with JDK 22-ea, but it is known to work with JDK 17 and later versions.
  * [**Dirk Lemmermann** is experimenting with 22-ea+9](https://twitter.com/dlemmermann/status/1707024018232983615): "Showing correct bold text on macOS and much lower initial memory consumption in our CRM software".

## Applications
