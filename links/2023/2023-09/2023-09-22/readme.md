## Applications

* [**Biometrics Engineer** shared a video](https://twitter.com/Biometrics_Eng/status/1704443412546474137) showing a "JavaFX Linux Biometric Time and Attendance - Staff Registration DEMO that is implemented on Ubuntu Linux using ARATEK A600 Biometric Fingerprint Scanner."
* [**RNArtist** is announcing](https://twitter.com/rnartist_app/status/1702674834193252446): "Installers will be available next week. Thanks to the very good tool JDeploy, you will automatically get the latest version after each launch of RNArtist. Now it's time to write some documentation..."
  * And shared [screenshots of the tool 3 years ago versus now](https://twitter.com/rnartist_app/status/1702641134923583639), with some very nice comments and links to the project in the thread.
  * BTW, as someone pointed out, you can maybe use this tool to design airport terminals... ;-)
* [**Sean Phillips** is using Trinity for](https://twitter.com/SeanMiPhillips/status/1703038446854345000): "Detecting ChatGTP generated medium size text blocks using manifold approximation, polyhedral volume techniques and JavaFX 3D. Sorry not sorry bad guys."
  * And [Apple M2 silicon (Arm64) builds](https://twitter.com/SeanMiPhillips/status/1703172036669972494) now supported through Trinity's GitHub Actions thanks to the magnificent CI work of samypr100!

## Games

* [**OrangoMango** announces "Chess 2.0 is finally complete"](https://twitter.com/orango_mango/status/1703057689582993815): "The WebFX version is now available at [orangomango.itch.io/chess](https://orangomango.itch.io/chess). Play single player against stockfish. Play multiplayer against a friend in LAN or on the server."
* Always fun when [**Almas Baim** shares one of his experiments with FXGL](https://twitter.com/AlmasBaim/status/1703483255331094569): "... and in this episode of how to inefficiently clear the screen ..."
* [**Ahmed Bakr** completed a Tic Tac Toe Game with Tiva C and JavaFX](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7109933250885685248/): "Our primary goal in undertaking this project was to explore the integration of microcontrollers with high-powered processing computers to tackle tasks beyond the capabilities of a standalone microcontroller."

## Components, Libraries, Tools

* [**Dirk Lemmermann** has a friendly reminder](https://twitter.com/dlemmermann/status/1704045289743495407): "When creating custom controls for your JavaFX project, please make sure you have a way to properly test them standalone (e.g. via [FXSampler](https://jfx-central.com/tools/fxsampler))."
  * He is also [pimping the CalendarView control in GemsFX](https://twitter.com/dlemmermann/status/1704846555004502306) and adding all kinds of options: "E.g. different layout for the header and also quick picking months and years). Come and check it out, let me know what you think or I missed."
* [**Pedro Duque Vieira** added a new API to FXComponents](https://twitter.com/P_Duke/status/1704488446138454335): "To allow you to change the native Window frame color, native Window text color, and border. (Standard JavaFX API will always show a native Window frame with the same light color with no possibility to change it.)"
