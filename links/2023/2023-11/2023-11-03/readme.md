* [**OrangoMango** shared an impressive video of 3D rendering](https://twitter.com/orango_mango/status/1719446338503671953): "Now the camera is always pointing to the airplane and it can also freely move. It's on the Raspberry Pi and with this resolution it lags a bit with the screen recorder."
* [**Serendipity** is proud](https://twitter.com/SerendigityInfo/status/1718268583208219073)! "Yes, we did it! A JavaFX APP is first in the Apple Store ranking for macOS! SmartFinder number one! Another small step for all Java lovers. JavaFX write once run anywhere."
* **Robert Ladst√§tter** announced v23.3.0 of LogoRRR, the tool to analyze log files and filter out critical events or other points of interest: "[Successfully resolved a significant performance issue in LogoRRR.

It is modern looking, very elegant, very professional, well documented, supports various modes (yes, dark mode and darcula, too), comes with an auto-updating sampler app, custom skins, much simpler styling rules than Modena, etc ... if you haven't done so, yet, please [check out the repo](https://github.com/mkpaz/atlantafx)."
