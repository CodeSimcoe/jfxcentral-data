## Core

* Right after last weeks' LOTW, [**Johan Vos** already had an update](https://mastodon.social/@johanvos/111147510047965780): "JavaFX 22-ea+11 has just been released to maven central (and on [gluonhq.com/products/javafx](https://gluonhq.com/products/javafx)). This contains the much anticipated memory improvements :)"
  * "This contains a major change in some CSS processing, see [this commit](https://github.com/openjdk/jfx/commit/5e145cc06ef68c50a4ffc95574fdafd44e054100), that leads to improved performance (less GC). Please test and evaluate."

## Applications

* [The Hero app by **Pedro Duque Vieira** has an alert/error system where the button will show as filled whenever there's an error/alert](https://twitter.com/p_duke/status/1707409002026463457): "This immediately warns u in a subtle way that u may have things to fix. After you've fixed everything the alert button shows up empty."
