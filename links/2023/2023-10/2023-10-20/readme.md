## Applications

* **Pedro Duque Vieira** shared more info and a video about [Visual Styles in HERO](https://twitter.com/P_Duke/status/1713901762027905025): "It allows the user to see properties of his CAD project quickly, at a glance."
* Nice new [screenshot by **RNArtist**](https://twitter.com/rnartist_app/status/1714315738691903512) showing: "Insight into a random RNA 2D with a size of 1kb and a pairing density of 60%. Bracket notation with colored helices in the lower part. Simple rendering of the 2D plot in the upper part.".
  * Here you can find [a picture to summarize the new workflow](https://twitter.com/rnartist_app/status/1715295482195349674) that will be in RNArtist 1.1.0.
  * And he shared a blog post: [Visualize experimental data on your RNA 2D](https://fjossinet.github.io/visualize-experimental-data/).

## Games

* [**Almas Baim** shared a video](https://twitter.com/AlmasBaim/status/1658565437053980691) after a "fruitful discussion with game dev students on how to improve the UI. Check out the new health and weapon indicators around the player. Now there is no need to look elsewhere to get this info."

## Components, Libraries, Tools

* True Dark Mode on Windows10 [will be available soon in a new release of FXThemes](https://twitter.com/P_Duke/status/1714655184327168474), a library by **Pedro Duque Vieira**: "Win10 is the most used Windows version (Windows being the most used OS). This was a pain to implement. Native code is different from win11. On win10 this API is undocumented."

## JFX Central

* We already mentioned a few times the tutorials by **Edward Nyirenda Jr** in these Links Of The Week. You can [find them now in our tutorial-section](https://www.jfx-central.com/tutorials/coderscratchpad) and we are working with Edward to include some of his tutorials in JFX Central itself! More info later...
* A [first video by **Dirk Lemmermann**](https://twitter.com/dlemmermann/status/1714227457086124072) showing JFX Central running as an app on iOS.
