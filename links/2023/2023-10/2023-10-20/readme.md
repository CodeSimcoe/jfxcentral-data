* **Pedro Duque Vieira** shared more info and a video about [Visual Styles in HERO](https://twitter.com/P_Duke/status/1713901762027905025): "It allows the user to see properties of his CAD project quickly, at a glance. 3 types exist:

- Discrete: properties that have a discrete value
- Dynamic Properties
- Graded: for properties that have, for example, a numerical value. In this case the property value will fit in a specific bucket

- Colors are given automatically by HERO and chosen from a color palette. They have been carefully pre-selected to give the highest visual feedback. Visual Styles adapt to the userâ€™s project file and continue to change automatically if the values of properties in the project change.
