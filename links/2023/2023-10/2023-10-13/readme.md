## Podcast, Video, Books

* In the list of JavaFX Devoxx talks last week, we missed this one by **Thanos Stratikopoulos**: [TornadoVM: Write once, run everywhere everywhere!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POanHvoC4qA). He demonstrates an impressive performance boost with a JavaFX ray tracer using the GPU. Sources of the demo are available on [github.com/Vinhixus/TornadoVM-Ray-Tracer](https://github.com/Vinhixus/TornadoVM-Ray-Tracer).

## Miscellaneous

* [**Pedro Duque Vieira** shares a video](https://twitter.com/P_Duke/status/1711370140216955086) to illustrate that a JavaFX scene graph can handle a lot of nodes: "The view on the left is using retained mode rendering. There are more than 1k nodes visible at a time and yet without major optimizations it runs fine. Tip: No need to rush to a Canvas implementation (immediate mode)."
