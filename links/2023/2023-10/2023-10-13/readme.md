## Applications

* **Tobias Briones** is working on [Building Slides from Screenshots App in JavaFX: "A great title where I granularly blogged the development of a powerful JavaFX desktop app"](https://blog.mathsoftware.engineer/leveraging-git-to-finish-my-article-2023-10-09).
  * And he has a ["JavaFX app that uses Tesseract OCR to detect words in the slide images, allowing users to underline them accurately"](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/tobiasbriones_softwareengineering-machinelearning-ai-activity-7117552150427095040-uYtb/). 

## Games

* **GZYangKui** has spent some time optimizing the audio and video output of his Nintendo-like game: ["The results were quite satisfactory"](https://twitter.com/YangKui7/status/1711764945946501188). 
* **Alessio Vinerbi** is making a [trash game](https://twitter.com/Alessio_Vinerbi/status/1710307540775354454).

## Components, Libraries, Tools

* **JPro** announced [version 2023.3.0](https://www.jpro.one/docs/current/3.1/2023.3.X): JavaFX 21 is used by default, and many more improvements!

## Podcast, Video, Books

* In the list of JavaFX Devoxx talks last week, we missed this one by **Thanos Stratikopoulos**: [TornadoVM: Write once, run everywhere everywhere!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POanHvoC4qA). He demonstrates an impressive performance boost with a JavaFX ray tracer using the GPU. Sources of the demo are available on [github.com/Vinhixus/TornadoVM-Ray-Tracer](https://github.com/Vinhixus/TornadoVM-Ray-Tracer).
* Already shared last week: Devoxx talk by **Kevin Rushforth** about [JavaFX Notebook](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9yhbaN5Xxs).
  * [Remark by **Chad Preisler**](https://twitter.com/cpreisler/status/1710291345590345799): "JavaFX Notebook would attract the scientific community to Java, because if you're crunching large amounts of data there is nothing faster than JavaFX and Java, and scientists are usually not programmers. This needs to be easily extendable."
* **Robert von Burg** and **Frank Delporte** had some fun during a live [video stream with LED strips and a JavaFX UI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eToIXACqSuY).

## Tutorials

* Please keep an eye on **Edward Nyirenda Jr**'s website as he keeps on giving! For instance, ["JavaFX with Gradle"](https://coderscratchpad.com/javafx-with-gradle/) was published last week.

## Miscellaneous

* [**Pedro Duque Vieira** shares a video](https://twitter.com/P_Duke/status/1711370140216955086) to illustrate that a JavaFX scene graph can handle a lot of nodes: "The view on the left is using retained mode rendering. There are more than 1k nodes visible at a time and yet without major optimizations it runs fine. Tip: No need to rush to a Canvas implementation (immediate mode)."
* Impressive 3D results by **OrangoMango**, considering he is running it on a Raspberry Pi: ["If I render the triangles, the application runs at 5 fps."](https://twitter.com/orango_mango/status/1711777605702005138).
