* Together with the [release of OpenJDK 20](https://foojay.io/today/its-java-20-release-day-heres-whats-new/), we also got the release of OpenJFX 20. Both right on schedule, as always!
  * [Announcement by **Gluon**](https://foojay.social/@gluonhq@techhub.social/110061453814740449).
  * Downloads are also provided via [OpenJDK on jdk.java.net](https://mastodon.social/@openjdk/110073623815076629).
  * Important message [in the release notes](https://github.com/openjdk/jfx/blob/jfx20/doc-files/release-notes-20.md): "JavaFX 20 is compiled with --release 17 and thus requires JDK 17 or later in order to run. If you attempt to run with an older JDK, the Java launcher will exit with an error message indicating that the javafx.base module cannot be read."
  * [Most important highlight for **Johan Vos**](https://twitter.com/johanvos/status/1638168304664694787): "apps created many years ago still run on the latest JavaFX with latest OS. That is far from trivial, require lots of work, and not very common in client frameworks."
  * And another [quote from **Johan**](https://mastodon.social/@johanvos/110061627191368710): "I remember people and companies telling me 5 years ago they love Java and JavaFX, but they were pretty sure JavaFX would not be around in 2 years from them. So they used other client technologies... which don't exist anymore today... while JavaFX... keeps moving forward. With less hype, and less marketing power than other client frameworks, but with dedication and focus on quality, stability and community."
And with tons of stuff todo, I 100% realize that."
* A [request by **Raumzeitfalle**](https://twitter.com/Raumzeitfalle/status/1638993956796239873): "If you like Java and JavaFX, give Scene Builder Leadinge Edge a try. Its latest version runs with Java 20 using JavaFX 20 and it combines many of the pending PRs so that one can test the functionality. Feel free to share your feedback on Github."
* **Dirk Lemmermann** again shared a lot of JavaFX library and other info:
  * "If any of you work on  [planning and scheduling applications I can highly recommend #FlexGanttFX for visualizing plans / schedules](https://twitter.com/dlemmermann/status/1638910874261000192). Yes, it is a commercial library."
  * "If your JavaFX application requires an [on-screen keyboard, you might wanna check out KeyboardFX](https://twitter.com/dlemmermann/status/1638903750726418432)."
  * A screenshot of the new market data portal he is creating, [running in a browser](https://twitter.com/dlemmermann/status/1638854795074338816).
  * The new [calendar view in GemsFX now also supports "date range" selection](https://twitter.com/dlemmermann/status/1638103850107260930) (and single date, multiple dates selection).
  * Thanks to [**Florian Kirmaier**, GemsFX has been extended with a great utility class for synchronous scrolling of two VirtualFlow instances](https://twitter.com/dlemmermann/status/1638107356188798977).
  * And he's worried about his job as ["ChatGPT "generates" a JavaFX app based on requirements"](https://twitter.com/dlemmermann/status/1638137320846106625). That's probably thanks to the stability of the API over the last years!
* [**WhiteWoodCity** shared a video](https://twitter.com/WhiteWoodCity/status/1638528428440944640) of rougelike game prototype.
  * And shared how he created a [pseudo 3D effect like Street of Rage, Dragon's Crown](https://twitter.com/WhiteWoodCity/status/1636904813228331010) with two GameSubScene and two entities of each GameWorld, and binding their properties with very clean and neat code.
* [**Almas Baim** is throwing grenades](https://twitter.com/AlmasBaim/status/1637915086571606016).
* [**OrangoMango** added some new block types and fixed some issues with block breaking/placing in his Minecraft-like world](https://twitter.com/orango_mango/status/1636834800127586310), and now has a small home made out of wood and coal blocks.
  * [**Sean Phillips** - being a JavaFX 3D expert - finds his work awesome](https://twitter.com/SeanMiPhillips/status/1638332315163082753).
* [**RNArtist** shared again an impressive video](https://twitter.com/rnartist_app/status/1637923762438918150) showing RNA visualization with JavaFX.
  * ["In RNAStudio, you can animate the transcription process](https://twitter.com/AlmasBaim/status/1637915086571606016) along one of the computed folding pathways. When a new helix pops, it is first highlighted then added to the 2D. You can stop/restart the animation, go backwards/forwards."
* [**Matt Coley** has a long Twitter thread about new the Recaf UI JavaFX work](https://twitter.com/invokecoley/status/1637693418192228352), starting with a 'please wait while the decompiler runs' animation that pulls hex dumps from the class being decompiled, and many more each with a video.
