* [**Gluon** announced the first set of JavaFX releases in 2023](https://techhub.social/@gluonhq/109710794664474768):
  * JavaFX 19.0.2: public release containing some updates and security patches to JavaFX 19.
  * JavaFX 11.0.18 and JavaFX 17.0.6: for LTS customers who keep supporting the development, and who make it possible to move JavaFX forward.
* [Shared by **JavaFX3D**](https://twitter.com/JavaFX3D/status/1615214627868246016): "Go from Figma to a fully Responsive JavaFX Application with support for navigation, responsive sizes, images and more."
* [**Botond Hegyi** already had some experience with JavaFX game development](https://twitter.com/HbotondS/status/1615328894382473219), but he found out working with [FXGL by **Almas Baim**](https://twitter.com/AlmasBaim) is sooo much easier.
* [**WhiteWoodCity** shared a video](https://twitter.com/WhiteWoodCity/status/1615311572397883395) shared a video of a self-made TableView.
  * [**Dirk Lemmermann** replied this is actually an important tweet](https://twitter.com/dlemmermann/status/1615385837432184832). as many JavaFX developers think they "have to" use the TableView, and then complain about its limitations. Using GridPane you can create your own custom table view, as most HTML devs do for tables.
  * And [another video showing a HDFS management system created with JavaFX](https://twitter.com/WhiteWoodCity/status/1614644198187347970).
* [**Matt Coley** discovered that JavaFX CSS allows you to effectively create borders](https://twitter.com/MattColey6/status/1614826723127836672) just with the background color/insets property. This fixes the effect of changes in the component when you add a border, and padding changes are needed.
  * And he shared a [preview of the new attach window in Recaf (Java bytecode editor )](https://twitter.com/MattColey6/status/1616044636199440384), that shows remote process properties and JMX beans, and indicates which JVM you're attached to with highlighted components.
* [**Sean Phillips** announced that the master branch of FXyz3D](https://twitter.com/SeanMiPhillips/status/1614054671684886528) has been updated to build with Gradle 7.6 and JDK 17 thanks to [**José Pereda**](https://twitter.com/JPeredaDnr), and is working on several fixes and updates coming soon for the release of version 5.5.
* [**OrangoMango** shared a video of a rendering of an .obj file](https://twitter.com/orango_mango/status/1616195870911000576) with only the use of the JavaFX canvas, including camera movement and rotation.
* New releases:
  * [23.1.0 of LogoRRR by **Robert Ladstätter**](https://twitter.com/rladstaetter/status/1615025146015645708): builds for Linux, visual improvements, autoscroll support,...
  * [11.12.45 of CalendarFX by **Dirk Lemmermann**](https://twitter.com/dlemmermann/status/1614939333244452866): very important fixes related to memory leaks that can happen when constantly recreating calendar views.
