## Core

* When [**Johan Vos** shares his note](https://mastodon.social/@johanvos/112477892809739391), you may want to keep on eye on them...: "While working on Java on Mobile, I [keep my notes here](https://download2.gluonhq.com/mobile/) (best viewed with lynx). This is not user/developer documentation, but people interested/familiar with OpenJDK building might keep an eye to see how far we are."

## Applications

* [**Aman Singh** is excited to share his latest project](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7196818552274767872/): "An Internet Download Manager built using JavaFX! With features like dynamic URL input, file management, and multi-threaded downloading, it's designed to streamline your downloading experience. [Check out the code](https://github.com/Aman298871/Internet-Download-Manager) and let me know your thoughts!"
* [**Pedro Duke**](https://x.com/P_Duke/status/1791442291070058732) shared a [video of Hero version 4 in action](https://youtu.be/P06dmx-SpkM?si=l6QkoY2fTQR-9sk7) which uses JMetro, FXThemes, and FXSkins.
* [**Christopher Schnick** shared](https://x.com/crschnick/status/1791903229397103051): "XPipe 9 comes with an integrated VNC client, written in JavaFX! Get it from [GitHub](https://github.com/xpipe-io/xpipe)".

## Miscellaneous

* Some JavaFX love on X ...
  * [**Xiong Chun**](https://x.com/DaXiong008/status/1792070496152076630): "Yep, JavaFX may take a good balance between cross-platform features and performance. In fact, I used Electron+Vue 3 to dev Datacollie. However, I found this architecture pattern, interactive experience and the performance are all not good enough for me. So, I switched to JavaFX."
  * [**Evander Torres**](https://x.com/EvanderTor57903/status/1792001252349346050): "I like JavaFX and Gluon not only because it has very proven and tested UI components but they are updated with the latest Java versions so you can take 100% advantage from Java."
  * [**Junior ADI**](https://x.com/caifyoca/status/1791530281058357650): "Done! JavaFX is seriously interesting. Give a try."
  * [**lucia scarlet**](https://x.com/luciascarlet/status/1793317192890507599): "If you're gonna use Java for the love of all that is holy use JavaFX instead of Swing because Swing apps are Distinctly Unpleasant to use (far, far more so than any Electron app). I would also look into Compose Multiplatform on Kotlin though."
* And some Kotlin+JavaFX love ...
  * [**Daniel Zimmermann**](https://x.com/DystopianSnow/status/1793140611773554938): "To your dismay I have to tell you I write all my desktop applications using Kotlin and JavaFX..."
* **Dirk Lemmermann** has created a new repository for utility classes related to using the [Retrofit framework](https://square.github.io/retrofit/) (a type-safe HTTP client for Android and Java) in a JavaFX applications: "Obviously it is called [RetrofitFX (on GitHub)](https://github.com/dlsc-software-consulting-gmbh/RetrofitFX) and currently contains a total of two classes :-) Most importantly a class called ServiceInvocation which runs async server calls via Retrofit and then returns the result on â€ the JavaFX thread via various handlers that can be attached to the ServiceInvocation class. Hope some of you will find it useful ... although pretty specific."

## JFX Central

* A new library has been added: ["ChartFX" for creating scientific charts](https://jfx-central.com/libraries/chartfx), thanks to **Ralph J. Steinhagen**.
