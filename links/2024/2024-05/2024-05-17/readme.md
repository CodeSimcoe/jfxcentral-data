## Applications

* [**Robert Ladstätter** announced a new release of LogoRRR](https://twitter.com/logorrr/status/1785790043451249020): "This update is a maintenance release with visual improvements and bugfixes. Internally, substiantial work was done to improve test coverage (End2End tests and performance tests)."
  * And a [video shows a new viewport visualisation](https://twitter.com/logorrr/status/1789428827828974030) of the current visible text in the box view on the left.
  * And did you know [you can play Snake with your logs](https://twitter.com/logorrr/status/1788685166547800300)?!
* **Sean Phillips** is on a roll again with a Twitter Thread with a lot of amazing 3D data visualizations.
  * "[Hi res Lunar elevation scans combined with hi res color spectrum imagery](https://twitter.com/SeanMiPhillips/status/1789361307361083527) (100m accuracy). Working on an easy to use Line Of Sight viz for Lunar surface assets. Mixing JavaFX and the NASA WorldWind Java SDK is a very powerful combination!"
  * "Borrowing from Worldwind's Line of Sight example I integrated a [JavaFX point & click tool with hi res lunar elevation data/terrain](https://twitter.com/SeanMiPhillips/status/1790000502555451591). Upgraded the computations to run using #Java parallel streams. 100 LOS checks computed/rendered < 1 second. Developed in a weekend."
  * "[Extended the lunar LOS tool by several orders of magnitude to check for performance](https://twitter.com/SeanMiPhillips/status/1790084437029327307). 10k LOS checks, 30k 3D artifacts added to the scene: 244 ms (including the rendering)... on a decent laptop. But Java is slow and JavaFX sucks and all those other foolish things you hear..."
