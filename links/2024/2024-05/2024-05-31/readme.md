## Core

* [Nice visualization by **afoo**](https://x.com/afoo_me/status/1795340765469855915) to illustrate the flow of event phases (capturing with EventFilter versus bubbling with EventHandler) in JavaFX.

## Applications

* [**Emad Hanif** shared an update of this Barcodify application](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/emad-hanif-00b4aa227_javafx-activity-7201626665133785090-eHOS/): "It's been a great month working with JavaFX. By the way, the application is now faster and more memory efficient. Templates are generated in batches, columns are processed concurrently, and everything is merged into a single PDF — all while maintaining perfect alignment. Soon, will be sharing short video to demonstrate the magic!"
* [**Heshan Kariyawasam**](https://x.com/Heshantk) is [working on Libro](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/heshanthenura_java-javafx-library-activity-7200502273158885376-uak0/): Open Source Library Management App. The sources are on [GitHub](https://github.com/heshanthenura/Libro).
* [**Xiong Chun** shared a video](https://x.com/DaXiong008/status/1795857529894781252): "Since I started using EventBus in JavaFX, my UI element and  content changes are entirely event-driven/data-driven, making development more streamlined. I've recently completed my Datacollie's interaction effect with selected tree node and the data displayed in the right-pane."

## Components, Libraries, Tools

* [**Carl Dea** published a lightweight JavaFX MVVM library "Cognitive"](https://x.com/carldea/status/1796344316618817798) on GitHub and Maven Central, with [a lot of info and examples here](https://github.com/carldea/cognitive/wiki).

## Miscellaneous

* Continuing the JavaFX love...
  * [**Gerrit Grunwald**](https://x.com/hansolo_/status/1794086894008930686): "After more coding I think now it’s time for the weekend... and again I realized that JavaFX is so productive... amazing."
  * [**Tanmay**](https://x.com/maytanthegeek/status/1794393624995885123): "Not gonna lie. I still love JavaFX. Android layout learned a lot from it. JavaFX is so fun and simple. I would really like to see it take a leading spot some day for GUI programming."
