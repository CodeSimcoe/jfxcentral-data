This release comes with some nice improvements for TeXLaTeX users and experimental support for using bst styles as preview."
* [WebFX shared](https://x.com/WebFXProject/status/1815417115161121078) an app they are hosting at [meteo.webfx.dev](https://meteo.webfx.dev): "It showcases some cool webfx features: Scene graph (no canvas), Charts, Dual CSS (javafx & web), I18n, Json, Web service, Java service, Local storage, Sound."
* [**Patrik KarlstrÃ¶m** shared screenshots](https://x.com/PatrikKarlstrom/status/1816016154852299111): "Bringing back the cron like scheduler to my JavaFX based rsync gui. Converting the old swing cron dialog was much less work than expected. JavaFX really do have nice things to offer!"
* Datacollie, the SQL UI by [**Xiong Chun** looks more-and-more impressive](https://x.com/xiongchun007/status/1816419820268605848): "The paging model of the SQL query result is determined, and a toolbar is added to the result table."

## Games

* [**OrangoMango** made a game in 24h for the indiedevgamejam](https://x.com/orango_mango/status/1812950078665204134): "Escape and drive on the highway as long as you can. By driving on the 2 leftmost lanes you get double score as well as driving fast." You can play it on [orangomango.itch.io/milkywayescape](https://orangomango.itch.io/milkywayescape).

## Components, Libraries, Tools

* [**Pedro Duke** shared a video](https://x.com/P_Duke/status/1815390389974503934): "A bunch of changes coming to Transit Theme... One of them is that if you change it to Dark style it will also change the Window frame of where the theme is applied. (JavaFX always shows the Window frame in light color)"
  * And Pedro published a new post: ["Transit Version 2.0 Released"](https://pixelduke.com/2024/07/24/transit-version-2-0-released/): "Styles work as User Agent Stylesheets like Modena (much easier to override) + True Dark Mode (Window frame also changes when set to Dark style)."
* [**Dirk Lemmermann** shared a screenshot of an implementation of the FlexGanttFX library](https://x.com/dlemmermann/status/1816511301369331865): "We use it in our energy CRM system to visualise the consumption data provided by the home-installed electricity smart meters of our customers. In addition, it shows the time when our backend services send a request to the meters to send their data and which time periods they requested."

## Podcasts, Videos, Books

* **Frank Delporte** published a [video in which he experiments with the Azul Zulu runtimes with JavaFX support, JBang, and SDKMAN on a Raspberry Pi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhDQvkcYJ88)  and a lot of colored circles.
  * Based on this experiment, he published an additional blog and video with a demo application to compare the performance between [thousands of Nodes versus drawing the same number of elements on a Canvas](https://webtechie.be/post/2024-07-22-javafx-nodes-versus-canvas/).
* YouTube Shorts by **OrangoMango**:
  * [Falling sand with JavaFX](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/2T3UNo5EVXg)
  * [Conway's Game Of Life implementation in Java and JavaFX](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/iaOnGQj86lQ)

## Miscellaneous

* [**Gerrit Grunwald** shared a screenshot](https://x.com/hansolo_/status/1813616079769686335) of a private project ("sorry not allowed to share...") which recreates the [QLOCKTWO](https://www.qlocktwo.com/en-be/) in JavaFX.
* [Christopher Schnick** reports](https://x.com/crschnick/status/1814024272295178515): "Seems like JavaFX applications run fine on Windows ARM systems through the x86_64 compatibility layer."
* [**Chris** is wondering](https://x.com/cbm64/status/1815503568897540159): "Why are large displays in public spaces, including electronic ordering screens windows based?! It should be JavaFX territory running lightweight Linux on an SOC device."
