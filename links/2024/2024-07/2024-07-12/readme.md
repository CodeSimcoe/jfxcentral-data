## Core

* A message by **Kevin Rushforth** on the [openjfx-dev@openjdk.org](https://mail.openjdk.org/mailman/listinfo/openjfx-dev) mailing list shows the Java/JavaFX release train is approaching the next station ;-): "Bump the version number of JavaFX to 24. I will integrate this to `master` as part of forking the `jfx23` stabilization branch, which is scheduled for Thursday, July 11, 2024 at 16:00 UTC." We're looking forward to the release of v23 in September!

## Applications

* **Igor Azarny** released v2.5.5 of [Gitember, a cross platform graphical user interface for GIT](http://gitgui.org/). You can find the [sources on GitHub](https://github.com/iazarny/gitember).

## Games

* [**Mark J Koch** is reverse engineering the "Game of the Year" from 1989](https://mastodon.social/@maehem/112747959541918758): "Screen grab of browsing the sprites extracted from the Neuromancer PC .DAT files. They are stored as indexed color, RLE and Huffman encoded blobs of data. I wrote some Java code to extract/decompress/decode them from the file and write them to a 'cache' directory as PNG files. The game came on two floppies and is still one of my favorites and I play it in a DOS emulator from time to time."

## Miscellaneous

* [**Mark Fortner** replies](https://x.com/phidias51/status/1809962623448023389) to a message by [**Justin Fagnani** about Flutter](https://x.com/justinfagnani/status/1809709077150462075): "It’s always interesting watching people re-invent the future. JavaFX has all of the features that you describe. Scenegraphs, multilanguage support, compiles to WASM, CSS. I think it really boils down to one’s willingness to get out of one’s comfort stack."
* A new [video by **Christopher Schnick**](https://x.com/crschnick/status/1809740192514793762): "The JavaFX 22 platform preferences API in action with native window themes on Windows 11."
