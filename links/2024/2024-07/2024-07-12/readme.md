## Core

* A message by **Kevin Rushforth** on the [openjfx-dev@openjdk.org](https://mail.openjdk.org/mailman/listinfo/openjfx-dev) mailing list shows the Java/JavaFX release train is approaching the next station ;-): "Bump the version number of JavaFX to 24. I will integrate this to `master` as part of forking the `jfx23` stabilization branch, which is scheduled for Thursday, July 11, 2024 at 16:00 UTC." We're looking forward to the release of v23 in September!
