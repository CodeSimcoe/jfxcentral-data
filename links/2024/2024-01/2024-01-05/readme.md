## Components, Libraries, Tools

* [**Steve Hannah**](https://twitter.com/shannah78) published a new [IntelliJ Plugin for jDeploy](https://jdeploy.substack.com/p/new-intellij-plugin-for-jdeploy) to create a new desktop app with automated releases on GitHub in under 2 minutes: "In addition to creating the project locally, the wizard will create a new GitHub repository, that is set up to generate new releases on every commit. Within 30 seconds of creating your project, you should be able to download and install the app from GitHub releases." 
  * He also shared a GitHub project as a showcase for jDeploy: [Sample FXGL project deployed with jDeploy via GitHub releases](https://github.com/shannah/fxgl-test8).
* **Michael Gasche** shared a [showcase of a rapid development framework](https://products.autumo.ch/modules/overview#at_ui) on the Foojay Slack with some out-of-the-box functionalities (installer, licensing/registering, app-config, update-checks, some further dialogs) for Java FX UI apps. It has default views which can be used with a one-liner to show an HTML page, license dialog, or other content that can be switched off per platform, e.g. because the Windows installer already has one. The source code is [available here](https://products.autumo.ch/modules/overview#at_ui). The Registration module in the demo is a "dummy" as it is quite big and advanced and possibly involves a server.

## Podcast, Video, Books

* "This was fun! A live stream to do a game application code walk-through together with Almas Baim. We talked about JavaFX, FXGL, JBang, SDKMan, and much more..." The [recording of the live stream](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IufaUwDsHUA)) by **Frank Delporte** and **Almas Baim** provides a code walk-through of this blog post: [A JavaFX Game Application in a Single Java File with JBang and FXGL](https://webtechie.be/post/2023-12-14-jbang-fxgl/). 
* New book by **Peter Späth**: [Frontend Development with JavaFX and Kotlin: Build State-of-the-Art Kotlin GUI Applications](https://www.amazon.nl/Frontend-Development-JavaFX-Kotlin-State/dp/1484297164).
