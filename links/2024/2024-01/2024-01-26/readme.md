## Applications

* [Video with a walk-through of LogoRRR](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ogC95PX0Ag): "While exploring the log files is an essential part of troubleshooting, sometimes you may not want to go so deep. In fact, when you get an error, you may simply want to see what happened as fast as possible and in a clear way. LogoRRR is a tool that does precisely that and provides you with a quick way to filter out critical events or other points of interest."
* Some nice small demo applications again by [**OrangoMango**](https://twitter.com/orango_mango):
  * [Falling sand video](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/2T3UNo5EVXg)
  * [Clock drawn on the Canvas, running in the browser](https://orangomango.github.io/Clock/) with about [100 lines of code](https://github.com/OrangoMango/Clock/blob/main/src/main/java/com/orangomango/clock/Clock.java).
* **Patrik Karlström** is "[in the middle of a major facelift of mapollage](https://twitter.com/PatrikKarlstrom/status/1750568870241280298), a KML generator. This time combining JavaFX with NetBeans Java Platform. It's great as usual, and now I'm using the "output window" with all it's goodies like folding, coloring & links. It's all there, for free!"

## Games

* [**Almas Baim** found out](https://twitter.com/AlmasBaim/status/1749742997145583662) that: "team JavaFX is now right in the middle of JVM game projects on the 1st page of GitHub search with 3960 stars! Since FXGL is now 49.4% #Kotlin and 49.1% #Java, I had to cheat and include both `language: Java, language: Kotlin` in [the search](https://github.com/search?o=desc&q=java+game+language%3AJava+language%3AKotlin&s=stars&type=repositories)."
* [Max Rydahl Andersen](https://twitter.com/maxandersen/status/1750504675630022941) wants to collaborate with Almas to make FXGL and game development easier with JBang: "I'm happy to help to make [FXGL example games](https://github.com/almasb/FXGLGames) "jbang friendly" ... there are lots of ways we can do that."

## Components, Libraries, Tools

* [**Pedro Duque Vieira** is asking for help testing out FXThemes](https://twitter.com/P_Duke/status/1750632079430189283): "If you have a machine running Windows 10 can you run the fxthemes-samples subproject and tell me if the window that shows up has a background blur? The project is using Java17 for now..."

## Podcasts, Videos, Books

* [Airhacks #278: "Java at Azul: The Interesting Features"](https://airhacks.fm/#episode_278): [Adam Bien](https://twitter.com/AdamBien) talks with [Gerrit Grunwald](https://twitter.com/hansolo_) about Java desktop applications with Swing and JavaFX + many other topics.

## Miscellaneous

* Want to combine Quarkus and JavaFX? Seems work is ongoing:
  * A lot of [new comments in a Quarkus ticket](https://github.com/quarkusio/quarkus/issues/9313) started in 2020.
  * With a link to [quarkus-fx-extension](https://github.com/CodeSimcoe/quarkus-fx-extension).
* [**Laurent Bourgès** realized he needs to celebrate](https://mastodon.social/@laurent_bourges/111782539726528107) "10 years as openjdk committer, 10 years since first Marlin-renderer 0.3: 2014.01, and a new Marlin 0.9.4.8 release: 2024.01. I want to launch the Marlin-renderer Drawing Contest #MDC btw 01.20 and 02.03: _Please draw me a nice thing with the marlin-renderer_ in 3 categories. Submissions will be shared as png, svg, pdf files under author's declared license. What do you think?"
  * Geographic maps (gis)
  * Illustration / plans / complex charts
  * Computer arts
* A [tip from **Heshan Kariyawas**](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/heshanthenura_java-javafx-debugging-activity-7156150466643468289-GcHG/): "Before the production release of a JavaFX app on Windows using JPackage, enable the console with the `--win-console` flag for easy debugging. However, after the production release, no debuggers are available. This tip proved very useful for me today."
