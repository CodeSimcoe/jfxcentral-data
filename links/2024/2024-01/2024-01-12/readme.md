## Applications

* **Christopher Schnick** is working on a [standalone application running on NixOS](https://twitter.com/crschnick/status/1743296483544150114) with Deepin desktop environment: "The popup windows don't support transparency and the tray icon is cut off, but other than that it is working fine."
* **Robert Ladst√§tter** published a [new release of LogoRRR](https://twitter.com/rladstaetter/status/1745586922515288416): "This update brings enhanced zip file support and animated clipboard actions, alongside various bug fixes." [Here you can find the release notes](https://github.com/rladstaetter/LogoRRR/releases/tag/24.2.0).

## Podcast, Video, Books

* Nice video by **Akif (Sorest) KARACA** to help you [understand different sorting algorithms](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmoRQkmyPnk) (selection, insertion, quick, bubble, heap, shell) by visualizing them with JavaFX (in Turkish).

## Miscellaneous

* The JFX Adopters Meeting 2024 takes place on the 6th of March at ZEISS in Munich Germany.

* **Heshan Kariyawasam** [fell in love with JavaFX canvas](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/heshanthenura_javafx-java-night-activity-7149071331672616960-gXKa/): "So I'm going to simulate night sky. I'll try to add Constellations and Meteors so it will be more realistic."
  * And he shared this [list of coding challenges](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6ZiZxtDDRCi6uhfTH4FilpH) that he would like to solve with JavaFX. Keep scrolling, the list is very long ;-)
