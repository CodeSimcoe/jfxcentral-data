## Applications

* [**Carl Dea** bumped versions for ScenicView](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/carldea_java-javafx-activity-7153563217930125312-llns/): "Yay, my [PR was accepted](https://github.com/JonathanGiles/scenic-view) for the excellent JavaFX debugging tool ScenicView. It now works with JDK 11+ and JavaFX 21.0.1. I believe the release should be out soon, but if you want to the latest binaries just clone and build the project locally ðŸ™‚."
* [**OrangoMango** is having fun with maths](https://twitter.com/orango_mango/status/1746593368463876123): "Now the application automatically inverts the transformation equations and applies them to any function or quadratic equation for y."
