## Core

* [**Pedro Duke shared](): "RichTextArea control is now available for testing [in the JavaFX incubator module](https://github.com/andy-goryachev-oracle/Test/blob/main/doc/RichTextArea/RichTextArea.md). Also includes CodeArea control. You can find the [JavaDoc here](https://cr.openjdk.org/~angorya/RichTextArea/javadoc/jfx.incubator.richtext/module-summary.html)."
* [**Johan Vos** shared a screenshot](https://mastodon.social/@johanvos/112887802923547314): "Making progress. Running Java 23 and JavaFX 24-ea on an iPhone. Thanks to OpenJDK/mobile and Gluon tools."

## Applications

* **Frank Delporte** got challenged by his 14-year-old son **Vik** to create an app to "look at music.": "Vik hopes to become rich, while I took it as a challenge to learn more about MIDI and make my first Kotlin application. There is still much work to do, but I just [published this video with a status update](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR4PL8ufiDw). More info is on [melodymatrix.rocks](https://melodymatrix.rocks/)." Some parts of the code is [opensource on GitHub](https://github.com/codewriterbv/melodymatrix-app-views).
* [**Christopher Schnick** announced](https://x.com/crschnick/status/1816788292563616004): "Native window themes on macOS with JavaFX. Now finally released in XPipe 10.2!"

* [JabRef is introducing AI features](https://blog.jabref.org/2024/08/21/AI-chatting/): "Tired of reading through all the papers? Let AI generate a summary for you, or use it to 'chat' with your papers! Either connect with existing AI providers or use a local LLM installation. Check out the new feature, one of our GSOC contributors is currently working on. We use jvm-openai & Deep Java Library (DJL)."

## Games
