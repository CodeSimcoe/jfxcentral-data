* [**Dave Barrett**](@Polypragmatist) published a long article with a lot of example code [about new Binding and Listener features added to JavaFX in versions 19 and 21](https://www.pragmaticcoding.ca/javafx/subscribe_and_map): "I looked at the JavaDocs page for ObservableValue in both JFX 16 and 21. There are just 3 methods in JFX 16: addListener(), getValue(), and removeListener(). There are 9 methods in the JFX 21 version. Those 6 new methods (plus one in Observable) are what we are going to look at in this article. And yes, these are game changers!"
