## Miscellaneous

* Discussion on Reddit: [JavaFX at Oracle, present and future?](https://www.reddit.com/r/JavaFX/comments/1bodn5q/javafx_at_oracle_present_and_future/)
* [**Johan Vos** gets irritated...](https://mastodon.social/@johanvos/112155358077106884): "Even very smart people who I admire don't realize that the 'We have to write 3 clients (ios/android/web)' is wrong. You *can* do that, but technically there is no reason not to use Java once, and run it everywhere. Granted, the tools/docs/samples for Java Everywhere are way behind the web-copy-paste stuff. Nothing to do with technical stuff. It just doesn't fit in the big tech revenue models. So what?"
* [**Sean Phillips** on Twitter](https://twitter.com/SeanMiPhillips/status/1772343662447317204): "JavaFX is fun what can I say. It's great at combining 2D controls and overlays with 3D scenes. This allows me to interactively measure samples from the Biden Deep Fake robocall against known fake volumes to show which were faked and which were real. Super easy, takes 3 minutes."
  * He will be [presenting a new method for detecting Deep Fake Audio called Projected Volumetric Detection at DevNexus 2024](https://twitter.com/SeanMiPhillips/status/1771606914821931474): "Join me in Atlanta April 9-11 if you would like to know more about how to detect AI generated Deep Fakes using Java and JavaFX."
