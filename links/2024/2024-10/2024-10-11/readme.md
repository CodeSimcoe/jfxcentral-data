* Blog post by **Frank Delporte**: [End of the Road for JavaFX in JDK 8: Keeping Your Apps Alive ](https://thenewstack.io/end-of-the-road-for-javafx-in-jdk-8-keeping-your-apps-alive/): "_Oracle will end support for JavaFX in JDK 8 next March and will stop providing Java 8 builds with OpenJFX included, as explained in the Oracle Java SE Support Roadmap. This means that from April 2025 and onward, if you are using JavaFX, you need to find an alternative distribution if you’d like to continue to receive security updates._"
