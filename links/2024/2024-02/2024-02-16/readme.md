## Applications

* **Sean Phillips** is using the open source Trinity software for deep fake detection: "[This clip demonstrates visualizing a 3D Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)](https://twitter.com/SeanMiPhillips/status/1755246775504433374) of the January 2024 deep fake of US President Biden. Trinity is written in Java using JavaFX for rendering." 
* [PDFsam released the new PDFsam Basic 5.2.2](https://twitter.com/PDFsamOSS/status/1755193888908665333): "We upgraded the bundled Java, JavaFX and few other dependencies. We also fixed/improved drag and drop of files into the selection table with autoscroll at the edges and drop of files between rows." See the [release notes](https://blog.pdfsam.org/bug-fix/new-release-5-2-2-for-pdfsam-basic/2520/).

## Games

* **Almas Baim** announced new speech-to-text in FXGL:
  * "The next version of FXGL brings the fxgl-intelligence module with a range of features. [The one shown in the video is text to speech](https://twitter.com/AlmasBaim/status/1756048026882150872). The API is pure Java code. You can play with it very soon."
  * "An [example of speech to text](https://twitter.com/AlmasBaim/status/1756610895088636371), coming to the next version FXGL. The left app uses text to speech, the right one uses speech to text. Demo shows: Java String -> speech output (speakers) -> speech input (mic) -> String. Anyone wants to build speech controlled games? ðŸ˜ƒ"
* **Heshan Thenura Kariyawasam**, **OrangoMango**, and **Sean Phillips** are [cooperating on X and sharing experiences](https://twitter.com/SeanMiPhillips/status/1755640542120063394).

## Components, Libraries, Tools

* [**Hallvard TrÃ¦tteberg**](https://twitter.com/haltraet/status/1753728173387153866) shared [fxml-template-processor on GitHub](https://github.com/hallvard/fxml-template-processor): "String templates (preview in Java 21) allow you to inject expression values into strings, so you don't need to use explicit string concatenation, StringBuilder or formatting. An important point of template strings is building other data types from the string and constrain and validate the input accordingly. This project contains a String template processor for FXML, so you can use template strings for FXML code and convert to Node structures with FXMLLoader."

## Conferences, Podcasts, Videos, Books

* At Fosdem in Brussels, **Frank Delporte** showed a JavaFX AI-Chat-application based on LangChain4J to interact with a documentation set. The [video and links are available on his blog](https://webtechie.be/post/2024-02-02-links-presentation-experiment-ai-llm-chat-with-docs/).
* [**Wolfgang Weigend** announced](https://twitter.com/wolflook/status/1744805486690537806) the [final agenda online](https://www.zeiss.com/meditec/en/news-events/events/jfx-adopters-meeting.html) for the "JFX Adopters Meeting" on 6th of March 2024.

## Tutorials

## JFX Central

* Available soon: [new detailed icon page](https://twitter.com/dlemmermann/status/1756715833848459656) where you can find out everything there is to know about the icon, e.g. the Ikonli "literal" (code), the CSS rule, the Java code required, the maven / gradle dependency, the SVG path, and so on. The main reason for having this detail page is so that you can send a URL to somebody else pointing directly at a specific icon and all of its info.
