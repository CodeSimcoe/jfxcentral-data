## Core

A few highlights from the openjfx-dev@openjdk.org mailing list:

* Version 23 will [bump the minimum version of the JDK needed to run JavaFX to JDK 21](https://github.com/openjdk/jfx/pull/1370).
* A [new feature is proposed: RichTextArea](https://github.com/andy-goryachev-oracle/Test/blob/rich.jep.review/doc/RichTextArea/RichTextArea.md). "Intended to bridge the functional gap with Swing and its StyledEditorKit/JEditorPane. The main design goal is to provide a control that is complete enough to be useful out-of-the box, as well as open to extension by the application developers. We are looking for feedback, and will update the proposal based on the suggestions we receive from the community."

## Applications

* **David Youcef Khodja** [shared a video of Geoptic](https://twitter.com/DavidYKhodja/status/1759703816973283401), an app to measure distances and surfaces on maps: "I'm actually using my own custom UI controls and CSS inspired by IntelliJ IDEA", made with SpringBoot, JavaFX, Leaflet, JavaScript.
* **Heshan Thenura Kariyawasam** is [replicating Instagram's story feature](https://twitter.com/Heshantk/status/1758869052066329014): "This Java application dynamically changes background color based on the dominant color of uploaded images." Sources are [available on GitHub](https://github.com/heshanthenura/DominantBackgroundColor).
* **Namuan** [shared a video of MirrOllama](https://twitter.com/deskriders_twt/status/1759688935444287993): "Desktop application to talk to multiple models using [Ollama](https://github.com/ollama/ollama) (Get up and running with large language models locally). Idea is to use multiple (up to 3) models simultaneously and select the best answer. Ô∏èI built it for my own use but hopefully useful for others as well." Sources are [available on GitHub](https://github.com/namuan/mirrollama).

## Components, Libraries, Tools

* **Pedro Duque Vieira** [shared videos showing work in progress on NavigationPane Control](https://twitter.com/P_Duke/status/1760765867992731766) that's in the FXComponents library, using the FXThemes library behind the scenes to achieve a background blur effect on the window.
