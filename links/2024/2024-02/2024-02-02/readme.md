## Core

* [**Christopher Schnick** shared a video](https://twitter.com/crschnick/status/1752252092029251610): "The JavaFX 22 platform preferences API in action. You can now query and observe the system color schemes..
* In the openjfx-dev mailinglist, **Johan Vos** shared the following message: "I created a [branch in the jfx-sandbox repository](https://github.com/openjdk/jfx-sandbox/tree/johanvos-headless) for experimenting with a headless glass platform. This addresses [JDK-8324941](https://bugs.openjdk.org/browse/JDK-8324941) where I suggest a POC for a Headless platform. There are a number of use cases for this, including: 
  * Applications that require JavaFX rendering without presenting this to a window (and instead send it to a printer for example).
  * Running tests without requiring a window manager."

## Applications

* [**Amit Kumar Mondal** announced OSGi.fx v2.4.4](https://twitter.com/am1t_m0ndal/status/1753042932821623124): "Packed with enhancements, integrating Java 21 and JavaFX 21 seamlessly." OSGi.fx is an easy-to-use desktop application to manage OSGi frameworks remotely. You can find the [release notes on GitHub](https://github.com/amitjoy/osgifx/releases/tag/v2.4.4).

## Games

* [**ilyriadz** open sourced his JavaFX game engine "mawdja"](https://github.com/ilyriadz/mawdja) and "My javafx game ['Almaseer Almahtoom'](https://ilyriadz.itch.io/almaseer-almahtoom) RC1 was realized."

## Components, Libraries, Tools

* [**Frank Delporte** published a small update about the Lottie4J project](https://lottie4j.com/index.html) as he is diving deeper into the Lottie-format (vector animations for the web).

## Miscellaneous

* WebFX now [supports WebGL](https://github.com/webfx-project/webfx/discussions/27 ): "This means that you can program a JavaFX canvas with a WebGL context in the browser." A [web demo is available here](https://cube.webfx.dev/).
* [Message from **Johan Vos**](https://mastodon.social/@johanvos/111838246384894266): "[**Laurent Bourges**](https://mastodon.social/@laurent_bourges) is an exceptional *independent* OpenJDK and OpenJFX contributor. I guess most of the developers using his code don't even realise the amazing work he does. Please [let him know how much you appreciate his work on the Marlin renderer](https://mastodon.social/@laurent_bourges/111776388216851460)."
* [**Dirk Lemmermann** is a big fan of AtlantaFX](https://twitter.com/dlemmermann/status/1752347204474249564): "We liked the sampler app of [AtlantaFX](https://www.jfx-central.com/libraries/atlantafx) so much that we are now using it in-house for our own theming / styles app."
