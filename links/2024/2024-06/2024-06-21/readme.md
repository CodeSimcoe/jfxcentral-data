* [**Hallvard Tr√¶tteberg**](https://twitter.com/haltraet) shared [code of a LLM workbench to explore various parts of a RAG chain using Quarkus, LangChain4J and JavaFX](https://github.com/kantega/llm-starter-and-workbench) (with an extension allowing Quarkus to work with JavaFX): "The UI is rough, just what is needed functionally, but the project may still be interesting for others. It's also a showcase for a rare combination, a desktop app running on Quarkus."
