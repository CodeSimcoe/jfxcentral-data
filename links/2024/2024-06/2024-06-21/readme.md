## Core

* [**Friedhold Matz** shared a screenshot](https://x.com/FriedholdMatz/status/1776354116517732465) showing that WebView in JavaFX 22 now works with GraalVM 22+36.1.

## Applications

* [**Hallvard Trætteberg**](https://twitter.com/haltraet) shared [code of a LLM workbench to explore various parts of a RAG chain using Quarkus, LangChain4J and JavaFX](https://github.com/kantega/llm-starter-and-workbench) (with an extension allowing Quarkus to work with JavaFX): "The UI is rough, just what is needed functionally, but the project may still be interesting for others. It's also a showcase for a rare combination, a desktop app running on Quarkus."
* [**Sean Phillips** is taking requests and suggestions for Trinity](https://x.com/SeanMiPhillips/status/1802142816602108122): "If anyone has ideas they would like to see implemented in a 3D asteroids game or in the actual AI analysis tool, and it's feasible in my spare time, I will happily attempt to implement it. (and credit you!)"

## Games

* [WebFX shared a new update](https://x.com/WebFXProject/status/1803038702693740734) of the [online SpaceFX](https://spacefx.webfx.dev): "2 new weapons: Autofire Fury and Rainbow Blaster. Can you now score 100,000? All of this made possible only by the amazingly performant JavaFX game engine written by **Gerrit Grunwald** and the power of GWT."

## Components, Libraries, Tools

* **Dirk Lemmermann** uploaded a video to [demonstrate the AvatarView in GemsFX](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CaDcCvJZ7I).
