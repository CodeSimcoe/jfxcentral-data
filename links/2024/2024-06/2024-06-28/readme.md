## Applications

* In a XTwitter Thread, [**Emad Hanif** shares several videos of Barcodify](https://x.com/EmadHanif_/status/1806383935083233771): "Check out how easy it is to configure and export barcodes."
* [**Patrik KarlstrÃ¶m** is working on nbLauncher](https://x.com/PatrikKarlstrom/status/1804865421918491014), an app to build launcher configs for NetBeans Platform Apps: "Expect a release after testing and polishing." You can [find it on GitHub](https://github.com/trixon/nbLauncher).

## Games

* [**OrangoMango** shared](https://x.com/orango_mango/status/1805585806863602035) a [video showcase of his best projects since February 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npwdeEwLjpY): "JavaFX is the best ðŸ’ª."

## Components, Libraries, Tools

* **Dirk Lemmermann** is doing a "[2nd attempt at providing a reusable control in GemsFX that features a table view with built-in column-based filtering](https://x.com/dlemmermann/status/1805595281209118818) (aka iTunes-style filtering). Trying to use what I learned since I started coding JavaFX in 2013."

## Podcasts, Videos, Books

* **Frank Delporte** published a new ["JavaFX In Action" interview with **Robert LadstÃ¤tter** about LogoRRR](https://webtechie.be/post/2024-06-26-jfxinaction-robert-ladstatter/). It's a cross-platform log analysis tool written with Scala and JavaFX to find problems blazingly fast in log files with millions of lines.

## Miscellaneous

* [**Crystal Furman** wrote a long LinkedIn message about the use of JavaFX in education](https://www.linkedin.com/embed/feed/update/urn:li:share:7212075229894881280): "I encourage you to try out Java FX charts with your students. For some, data analysis is simply not going to be exciting, even if it is on a topic they care about. Adding some graphics, might just spruce up this project and make it more exciting for them. Hope you try it and let me know how it goes."
* [**Gerrit Grunwald** shares a screenshot](https://x.com/hansolo_/status/1806004059368784098): "JavaFX is simply super productive... Created this chart component in just 1.5h... From idea to running in my app... Just love it..."
* [**Carl Dea** is extending Cognitive, a JavaFX MVVM library](https://x.com/carldea/status/1805773088576974861), with a new feature, as [extensively documented on GitHub](https://github.com/carldea/cognitive/issues/2): "Additional way to look up properties using a Property Identifier type object instead of a String."
* Experiments by **konczdev**:
  * "[Git branch graph like JavaFx visualization entirely made by Claude 3.5 Sonnet](https://x.com/konczdev/status/1804825701134082331). All iterations. The input was just an image and a short prompt."
  * "[A little fun with Java 22, JavaFX and Project Panama](https://x.com/konczdev/status/1804591278073532624). Modified JavaFX window with a custom JavaFX title bar without any refection, JNI, JNA or native code."
