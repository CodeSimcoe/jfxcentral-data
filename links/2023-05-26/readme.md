Last week we skipped the #LinksOfTheWeek (family weekend), so this edition is a bit longer than usual...

## JavaFX Core

* [JavaFX 21-ea+17 is available for download from GluonHQ or from Maven central](https://techhub.social/@gluonhq/110374163797572361).
* [**Johan Vos** believes it's time to deprecate Java Swing](https://mastodon.social/@johanvos/110378814066039175): "It doesn't make sense to maintain Swing and move JavaFX forward. Deprecation doesn't mean it needs to be removed immediately. But let's deprecate it. We need to move forward, and we need the resources for this."

## SceneBuilder

* [**Raumzeitfalle** is wondering if you want to conveniently install Scene Builder 20 for JavaFX](https://twitter.com/Raumzeitfalle/status/1657471102673715202)? You can now do this thanks to the use of JDeploy.
* [Shared by **Johan Vos**](https://mastodon.social/@johanvos/110371523942727201): "Now that Scene Builder 20 is released, it is a good moment to work on functionality/bug fixes that can make it in 21. For most projects I work on, I prefer doing major changes shortly after a release, rather than shortly before a release."

## JavaFX Applications

* [**Christopher Schnick** is working on context menu actions for XPipe](https://twitter.com/crschnick/status/1661349160547766272). What else would you like to see added?
  * And he shared a [video with more AtlantaFX themes plus smooth theme transitions](https://twitter.com/crschnick/status/1661340242052251650).
* [**Alessio Vinerbi** seems to be working on MoonsonFX](https://twitter.com/Alessio_Vinerbi/status/1659864509320687619), an alternative AfterEffects application. This makes me very curious as he already showed other impressive UI-work.
* [**Juanan** seems to be working on a Mastodon client](https://mastodon.social/@juananpe/110383623013926873), see also his other Toots on Mastodon.
* [binjr (FOSS timeseries browser) 3.12 is available](https://fosstodon.org/@binjr/110380055859735465), with a new indexing mode for log files that makes it easy to search for arbitrary strings of character without the need for wildcards while maintaining the same level of performance, even on very large files.

## JavaFX Games

* [Pac-Man and Ms. Pac-Man by **Armin Reichert** ported to the web with WebFX](https://twitter.com/WebFXProject/status/1661336335427182593).
* [Rubik's cube v3.0 by **OrangoMango** is available on itch.io](https://twitter.com/orango_mango/status/1659545495704928257) for Windows, Android, Linux and Mac.
* [**Almas Baim** shared a video of a game where the player can now use the shockwave ability](https://twitter.com/AlmasBaim/status/1657718394064601089) once the meter is full. It allows the player to quickly clear out a safe path in front of them.
  * [And he had a fruitful discussion with game dev students on how to improve the UI](https://twitter.com/AlmasBaim/status/1658565437053980691). In the video, you can check out the new health and weapon indicators around the player, without the need to look elsewhere to get this info.

## JavaFX Components

* [**Matt Coley** made a minimal/flexible TreeMap chart](https://twitter.com/invokecoley/status/1660951086876749825).
* [**Christopher Schnick** is feeling magic with dynamic OS theme detection](https://twitter.com/crschnick/status/1658174428612550671)! Done with jSystemThemeDetector.
* [**Sean Phillips** got a lot of interest on the animated circular progress indicator](https://twitter.com/SeanMiPhillips/status/1658120303539519491) he made for Trinity and uploaded a version of it along with a tester app so folks could play with it.

## Podcast

* [**Adam Bien** and **Shai Almog** discuss JavaFX, Codename One, Swing, Flutter, and a Bit Android](https://airhacks.fm/#episode_242).

## JFX-Central

**Dirk Lemmermann** shared a lot of previews of the upcoming new version of jfx-central.com.

* [The "skeleton" for the detail pages](https://twitter.com/dlemmermann/status/1658067095664443394). It will be used to list information on people, books, libraries, tools, blogs, etc... Every page will be responsive and auto-adjust to large (desktop), medium (tablet) and small devices (phone).
* [The new showcases section](https://twitter.com/dlemmermann/status/1661055817041297409).
* [Videos will no longer be shown in a separate overlay, but "inline"](https://twitter.com/dlemmermann/status/1659203119136509955).
* [Ikonli will also have a nice new home](https://twitter.com/dlemmermann/status/1661325621471969281).
* [The shiny new home for the "links of the week" section](https://twitter.com/dlemmermann/status/1661718165577953280). Also coming soon... the RSS button.
* [Having a professional designer do your app's design is always worth the money](https://twitter.com/dlemmermann/status/1661676012466307072). Not only do you save time, but it will also look much better.

## Miscellaneous

* [**Dirk Lemmermann** is about to rent 190 square meters of office space in Zurich for our Swiss subsidiary of Senapt](https://twitter.com/dlemmermann/status/1657027053202423808). Exciting times, and JavaFX made that happen!
