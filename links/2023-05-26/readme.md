Last week we skipped the #LinksOfTheWeek (family weekend), so this edition is a bit longer than usual...

## JavaFX Applications

* [**Christopher Schnick** is working on context menu actions for XPipe](https://twitter.com/crschnick/status/1661349160547766272). What else would you like to see added?
  * And he shared a [video with more AtlantaFX themes plus smooth theme transitions](https://twitter.com/crschnick/status/1661340242052251650).

## JavaFX Games

* [Pac-Man and Ms. Pac-Man by **Armin Reichert** ported to the web with WebFX](https://twitter.com/WebFXProject/status/1661336335427182593).

## JavaFX Components

* [**Matt Coley** made a minimal/flexible TreeMap chart](https://twitter.com/invokecoley/status/1660951086876749825).

## JFX-Central

**Dirk Lemmermann** shared a lot of previews of the upcoming new version of jfx-central.com.

* [The "skeleton" for the detail pages](https://twitter.com/dlemmermann/status/1658067095664443394). It will be used to list information on people, books, libraries, tools, blogs, etc... Every page will be responsive and auto-adjust to large (desktop), medium (tablet) and small devices (phone).
* [The new showcases section](https://twitter.com/dlemmermann/status/1661055817041297409).
* [Videos will no longer be shown in a separate overlay, but "inline"](https://twitter.com/dlemmermann/status/1659203119136509955).
* [Ikonli will also have a nice new home](https://twitter.com/dlemmermann/status/1661325621471969281).
* [The shiny new home for the "links of the week" section](https://twitter.com/dlemmermann/status/1661718165577953280).
* [Having a professional designer do your app's design is always worth the money](https://twitter.com/dlemmermann/status/1661676012466307072). Not only do you save time, but it will also look much better.

## Miscellaneous

* [**Dirk Lemmermann** is about to rent 190 square meters of office space in Zurich for our Swiss subsidiary of Senapt](https://twitter.com/dlemmermann/status/1657027053202423808). Exciting times, and JavaFX made that happen!
